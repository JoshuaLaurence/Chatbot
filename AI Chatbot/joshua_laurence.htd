*S,* Philosophy & Ethics
I personally don’t agree with this statement. Civil disobedience often leads to more carnage than it does peace. For example, if people hadn’t practised civil disobedience during the reign of the nazi’s then who knows how many lives would have been saved. Not all of the nazi soldiers agreed with the views of hitler, but it made their lives easier to go along with what some of them knew was wrong rather than conflicting it and risking their lives in the process. Bonhoeffer, who was living through these disgraceful and disastrous times, believed that civil disobedience was not the right option. As he lived his life in discipleship (following the life, examples and teachings of Jesus), he believed there was no greater authority than Jesus and his teachings. So he saw his duty to God as astronomically greater than his duty to the state. However the Lutheran teaching teaches that Christians should be civil and obey the states laws and follow there orders, so there is a balanced argument for both sides. Civil disobedience is the idea that you should partake in the states laws and follow the states orders, even if they go against the teachings of Christianity or your own personal beliefs. I can understand why people may think that civil disobedience can be a better option than speaking out, or rebelling against the government. “There is no standing amid the ruins of one’s native town in the consciousness that at least one has not oneself incurred guilt” - Bonhoeffer. What Bonhoeffer is saying is that while your government or state is committing actions that will in the end lead to destruction or dismay, if your way of not joining civil disobedience is to do nothing, you might as well be civilly disobedient. To watch from the sideline while sin occurs is no better than being involved in the sin itself. I agree with this point, if you refuse to be involved in the states action if they go against what you believe. Then you should stand up for what you do believe, even if it leads to you yourself losing your life, you will go out knowing you were true to yourself and your beliefs. The argument prior is in a way similar to the trolley problem. There is a train hurtling towards five people on a track and your stood next to a railroad switch, if switched the train will switch to a different track with one person on. Either way someone is going to die, what do you do? This is similar because whether you get involved and flip the switch (which in this case is the example of civil disobedience) or walk away and let nature take its cause (which in this case is refusing to partake in civil disobedience but doing nothing to stop it) someone will lose there life. Either way something evil is going to happen no matter which one of the two you choose. But there is a third option with civil disobedience, uprise. Going against authority is a odd option to take, as it is very hard to say whether it will be more benefitial or negative. What I mean is often an uprising can lead to more blood shed than civil disobedience would have caused in the first place. It is very often that an uprising will lead to fighting of sum sort. For example the French Revolution, when the french had had enough of the state, they overthrew he monarchy and took control of the government, but in the process of the French Revolution so many lives where lost, of both innocent and guilty parties. Whether or not you should uprise against civil disobedience or just follow the state is very situational. At the time you would have to weigh up whether it will be more benefitial to uprise or to diligently follow. There is also the future impact of an uprising, which are impossible to judge. For example, if someone had succeeded in the overthrowing of Nazi Germany and Hitler, who knows how many lives would be saved today as a cause of it, but who also knows how many lives would have been sacrificed in order to overthrow them. You would have to take a very act utilitarian view if you were to do it in a logical way, weighing up which would bring the greatest benefit to the most people. The problem with this is, not only are the future impacts highly difficult to predict, there is also a huge quantity of emotion that comes into things, taking a more Prole view on the situation rather than looking at it from an Arch Angel perspective. Bonhoeffer believed in living life in discipleship, following the teachings of Jesus, so he believed his duty to God was much greater than his duty to the state, and he worked to help overthrow the Nazi party. He believed that an uprising was the best idea for the situation, he made a decision by weighing up all the outcomes and deciding his duty to save these people and follow in the path of Jesus was far greater than following a corrupted Nazi state. With the benefit of hindsight we realise this was obviously the best choice for any Christian to have chosen, but many would have followed in the footsteps of Hitler, even thought they didn’t agree with what he was saying or doing. There are so many Christian teachings that say state peaceful and follow the state, they may have read and followed these, but there are also several for fighting back and uprising. It is very hard for a Christian to choose. All these contradictions within the bible can be impossible to desired a coherent argument for either side. Romans 13:1 says “Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities”, Matthew 22:21 says “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s: and to God the things that are God’s”, and teachings like “love thy neighbour” and “turn the other cheek” seem to discourage any form of uprising that could lead to a disruption in peace, and promote following the state no matter what their orders may be. On the other side, quotes like “If you do not have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one”, “an eye for an eye” seem to promote revenge against people who you believe have done wrong by you, and in Acts 5:29 it says “But Peter and the apostles answered, ‘We must obey God rather than men’” surely insinuating that you should follow God rather than the state. I personally believe a Christian should seek to go against civil disobedience, and follow the teaching of revenge and following God aposed to the government. A Christian knows that following civil disobedience is wrong, as they are committing sin in order to follow the state. An uprising may cause more blood shed and harm in the short term, but in the long run as history has shown, they lead to more peace and happiness. As James 4:17 states “So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin”, saying if you sit on the side lines or join in the states negative spiral, not only are you committing the sins the state is telling you, but you are also sinning as you know its wrong to be taking part and know what should be done, but aren’t doing anything about it. In Romans 13, it goes on to say that people in authority are “God’s servants” and disobeying them will bring “judgement on themselves”, but I disagree. People in authority aren’t Gods servants, because before they came into authority, they were just people, what makes them Gods servants compared to others. Back in tribal times it was very unlikely there would be a ‘leader’ of sorts, everyone would work together on tasks, as a collective. Moreover, if people in authority are servants of God, this includes Mussolini, May, Hitler, Stalin and Putin, the list goes on and on. I find it very hard to believe that these are men are God’s chosen servants. Teachings such as ‘love thy neighbour’ and ‘turn the other cheek’ do promote peace, but they also promote ignorance. Turn the other cheek in this context would mean ignore the problem, pretend it isn’t happening, which as Bonhoeffer said is just as bad as being involved. Love thy neighbour would imply be nice to everyone, but what about murders and serial killers. I agree be nice to those who are nice themselves but if someone is a cold blooded killer why should you be nice to them. I’m not saying treat them horribly but you don’t have to be good and kind to them. And in the context of civil disobedience, love they neighbour leaves no rooms for uprising as with it there can be no enemy, which seems peculiar if there is no enemy then you can’t really have civil disobedience as the state wouldn’t be doing wrong in your eyes, so won’t be an enemy. For all of these reasons this is why I feel like the teachings for civil disobedience don’t hold as much weight for me as the ones against it. The teachings that support civil disobedience have too many contradictions and holes in them for me to think they are a valid argument for civil disobedience. But i can understand that some Christian’s may think that authority is just as or if not more important than God’s authority and take a more pacifist approach, following the state. I can also understand that some Christians may think that it is part of God’s authority that we should be following our civil authorities diligently, no matter how delusional and corrupted they can be. For me personally, I am on the side of rising against the state, and following God’s authority in a different way, in the way of James 4:17. So, to conclude. I personally disagree with this statement, I feel that in general civil disobedience can be much more destructive than it can be peaceful. While I can understand following civil disobedience as many Christians may believe it is what God would want us to do, I personally don’t agree. I follow in the footsteps of Bonhoeffer, and the teachings of Acts 5:19 in the way of uprising against the state when we believe it is doing wrong by us. And while in the short term it can often lead to more carnage than doing nothing, in the long run as history has shown and the benefit of hindsight can tell us, it would have often lead to more peace. In the words of Bonhoeffer “There is no standing amid the ruins of one’s native town in the consciousness that at least one has not oneself incurred guilt”.

I believe this statement to be true, as I find Augustine’s view on humans to be too negative and soul focus on all the bad things we will ‘inevitably’ do. He says that humans are, by default, sinful, due to the event of Adam and Eve and their sinful nature being passed through all the generations of humanity. In my opinion that is a very negative way to look at it and has a lot of flaws in its ideology. This is, like a lot of ideas, preaching to a certain crowd, ie if you don’t believe in the story of creation, then the whole idea falls apart very quickly. Even if you do believe in the creation story as fact, then when Christ died he dies for our sins, to repent for Original Sin and undo the actions of Adam and Eve. So it doesn’t make sense that we would still be born with this original sin. Augustine believes God gave us the gift to identify right and wrong, but we will inevitably do wrong. I don’t agree, while it is true we have the capabilities to do wrong actions, I believe that the majority of people are good, and given the choice would do the right thing. The counter to this, is most actions aren’t really good or bad, because the only constant force in the universe is God, and decisions made over material things, or things related to matter are always bad as they display Cupiditas (love for material things and selfish needs), so there isn’t a good outcome, as the outcome will always either give yourself some gain or be related to earthly items. As I said prior, Augustine brings great focus to the events of Genesis 3:1-6, The Fall Of Humanity. A well-known story by Atheists and Theists alike, Adam and Eve are lured by the serpent (which is known to be Lucifer), and eat the apple from the tree, one of the few things God had forbidden them to do. As a punishment, God banished them from the garden, and as a consequence of their action, not only allowed sin into the world but also put a big dent in humanities relationship with God. We were also given lust and self-awareness. Due to this event, Augustine believes that it caused what is called Original Sin, which was passed through Adam and Eve to the rest of humanity (as we are all descendants of Adam and Eve). Augustine still believes we were made in Gods image ‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule’ - Genesis 1:26, so we were originally good, but after the events of Adam and Eve our human will was broken and we became inherently bad. Augustine here is painting a negative view on humanity, one which I don’t believe is completely correct. I do believe that the majority of people are going to do more bad than good, but there are some people you will meet in life who are good people, and do things for others just because it makes the other person feel better and not for themselves. The thing that makes Augustine’s view so pessimistic is we can’t save ourselves, that no matter how good we are or how much we follow Gods teachings, the only thing that can save us is God’s Grace. Even if you are the best person the world has ever seen, at the end of the day it’s God’s choice, so you still might not get picked to be saved. The reason this is so pessimistic is that for a Christian even if you follow all the rules and live your life dedicated to God and try to stay on the right path to achieve the ‘Summum Bonnum’, you still might not make it to heaven for something you didn’t even do. In that case what really is the point of life, if the goal was attainable by living well, then there would be a glimmer of hope, but we can’t attain it alone. Some may interpret this to be that we are all evil beings with no way of making up for our sin, so there really isn’t any point to life and might just kill themselves because their point of living was to get to heaven and they now know there is a big possibility they won’t make it. Admittedly this is a very extreme way to look at it, but what Augustine's views do is remove any hope, they take away the light at the end of the tunnel which is what makes them so negative. 
Another thing Augustine does is twist every God-given gift we have to show how we use it for negative power. We have free will, but we abuse this free will and do bad things like murder and do things for financial gain. We have the ability to identify right and wrong, but we use this to identify the wrong actions and intentionally commit them. We have love, a force which drives humans to either a positive or negative conclusion, but he inevitably believes we will be swayed to the negative side, following Cupiditas (love for materialistic and selfish things) rather than Caritas (generous love for others, an expression of the will of God as Eternal Law). We were given the responsibility to be the guardians and Shepards of all species, but we misuse this and not only kill these species, but in a lust for more try and rule over our own. The main problem is I struggle to see anything positive in the views of Augustine, everything seems to be sombre and down. Ever since the fall sin was let into our world and I presume for Augustine a repercussion of this is the dominant force in the world became bad rather than good, and that all the good in the world seems to have dwindled. Even those who seek earthly peace are doing wrong, as earthly peace is only ever met to either benefit material goods, or for selfish reasons. Due to all these negatives the world and its people have, they should be and live as earthly people but keep their eyes on The City Of God, then they may be in with a chance to enter “Ecclesia” - Heavenly Society. At the end of the day, everything to do with Augustine's philosophy is a chance. There is only a chance we will be accepted to heaven, and that’s the only hope he provides in his deselect view on our planet. It’s not all negative thought, Augustine believes we are deeply social creatures and that friendship or ‘Concordia’ (the easy, comfortable and understanding relationship good friends have) is key and essential to all humans, along with being healthy both physically and spiritually. At the end of the day, it doesn’t actually matter as this life is pointless from an Augustinian point of view if you aren’t saved by the grace of God. The counter to all of this is that yes, the likelihood is that God’s grace won’t be felt by us, no matter how good we are, which would then lead on to life having not much point. But for me, the beauty of life is that its finite. If you’re watching a really good film, and you know at some point it’s going to end, no sequel or part two, it's just the end. You don’t immediately switch off the film and go ‘Well that was pointless then’, you enjoy it while it lasts. For me, the magic of life is that one day it will end, and that will be it. “One day you will eat your last meal, smell your last rose, hug your friend for the last time, and you might not know it’s your last time, so you should do everything you love with passion” - Ricky Gervais. As much as Ricky Gervais isn’t a philosopher I think the quote helps to validate my point, with all the pessimism in Augustine’s philosophy, with all the negatives of humanity and the fact we will die you can still see the positive side, and think why not just live life being good and enjoy it while it lasts. A Man and A theory were key in influencing Augustine and his views, Plotinus and Neo-Platonism. Plotinus is seen as the father of Neo-Platonism, and his books on Neo-platonism and other philosophies alike had a profound effect on Augustine and made him start to question our world. Plotinus said as humans we have three types of knowledge: Sense knowledge (knowledge of our world), Reasoned Cognition (knowledge of Platonic forms) and Ecstasy (Intuition and connection with, the one). In Neo-Platonism, the one is similar to the Christian God in the way it is a supreme being of God-like power which is necessary and wholly good. However the one does differ from God in so many ways, its: transcendent, simple, the source of our reality (reality emanates from the one, as an outpouring of its nature in an ongoing temporal process), beyond matter, has no consciousness and reflects itself onto lower planes (The Nous which is knowledge, The Soul which divides into the human and worldly soul, and Matter). The difference between Augustine and Neo-Platonism is in Neo-Platonism, you can bring yourself to a level of Ecstasy and climb the chain of Emanations (climb from Matter to the Soul, to the Nous) and come closer to the one through philosophy, virtue and doing away with concerns of the body. This feels like a more positive outlook on humanity, with dedication and perseverance you can achieve an Ecstatic Union with the one (which is similar to being enlightened), and there is evidence this is a possibly achievable goal. Plotinus is said to have achieved this union on several occasions throughout his life. Neo-Platonism believes that although we are predominately material, we are also immaterial, which allows us to climb the chain and join in union with the one. Augustine also believes this, ie we are material except for our immaterial minds, but he takes the negative spin on it that although we are immaterial we can’t use our minds to save ourselves, no rather God has to save us from ourselves. I much prefer and agree with the Neo-Platonistic view on human nature. I don’t believe we can’t save ourselves, but rather that many people either go about it wrong or can’t be bothered to try and reach this enlightenment, or Plotinus described it as True Happiness (we can ignore suffering and focus on eternal things, and reach inner peace of union with the one). Through philosophy and contemplation, and living as good people we can climb the ladder to the divine enlightenment and that when our lives are over, if we have done enough and done it right, we will be granted into heaven (then again I’m still unsure as to whether heaven exists or not, but if I choose the root of thinking it doesn’t, both arguments fall apart). So to conclude. I personally agree with this statement, as I feel Augustine's views on human nature focus on what he believes to be the inevitable negative rather than the possibility of positives. Humans are destined to sin, just at times in life isn’t true. The idea we inherit sin from Adam and Eve is also very dependent on if you believe on this story as gospel truth or as just a story, so it starts from the gate preaching to, what is now today a narrowing group of people. I do believe that we tend to be guided by Cupiditas rather than Caritas, but I don’t believe that we are always doing actions for selfish or material reasons. I feel like Augustine's views are very definite negatives, rather than my view that while Augustine’s views are true at times, they aren’t at others. I also think the idea that we can’t save ourselves is just plain wrong, through philosophy and contemplation combined with good deeds for selfless reasons makes you a good person, which in my mind allows you to gain access to the gateway to heaven. Following the views of Neo-Platonism, philosophy allows your immaterial mind to become in a union with God. So if we can reach God this way, then surely we can reach God in heaven through ways on our own. Augustine's views are far too pessimistic for me to get behind, as much as at times the world can feel all bad, there are good moment and good people in it which Augustine's views just don’t equate for.

I disagree with this statement. I think that the Bible has too many problems, interpretations, language issues, contradictions and cherry-picking to take it as a wholly trustworthy source. I am a big follower of Aristotle and I love his philosophies, so I believe that the visible world around us, ie natural and everything we see, is real and trustworthy. Whereas I do understand the idea of everything being deceptive and a lie, Solipsism is the view that the only thing that is certain to exist is one's mind (a very Descartian view), and I understand why things like natural and revealed theology may not seem trustworthy to these people, and that the bible seems more reliable (even though it is part of the physical world and could be a deception, so this idea doesn’t make a lot of sense to me). I feel the Bible has too many issues to be a reliable and trustworthy source to base our whole knowledge of God on, not only does it have problems but there are several other ways for me to feel or know things about God. For one, religious experience, which I believe to be a core way of gaining knowledge about God. Another is Natural Theology, I can go out tomorrow and look into my garden at the sunset and feel the presence of divinity or God through this. John Calvin believed that from birth, we have an innate sense of divinity inside of us, giving us innate knowledge of God. All of these things just can’t be gained from a book, no matter how holy it is. I believe Revealed Theology to be the most reliable way of obtaining knowledge of Gods existence. The key part of Revealed Theology is religious experience, where God reveals himself to you and might portray a message or an instruction. The mains part is that God finds you rather than you finding God. The problem with that is, not everyone can have an experience of this kind, so the few that do may write what they experience, and then comes all the problems which come with the written word of the bible. Religious experience is the main type of revealed theology, which in my opinion is the core of understanding and finding God. A posteriori knowledge for me is the superior type of knowledge, there are things and pieces of knowledge that you can get from experiences you would never be able to get through reason or deduction. My beliefs are similar to those of Rudolph Otto, “There is no religion in which it does not live as the innermost core and without it, no religion would be worthy of the name’. The ‘it’ Otto is referring to is, of course, religious experience. He believed, as do I that without it no religion would even be worthy of the term ‘religion’. I feel it would be better to put it into an example, if you read a book about war, you will create the image in your mind of what war is like, but if you play a game about war you get a sense of involvement that you just couldn’t get from the words on the page. The only problem with religious experience is that there is absolutely no way to prove it (ie people could be lying for attention or the use of substances might have influenced the experience), and to define it as a religious experience (ie, was the person mistakes, how do we know the experience was religious, etc). At least 10 philosophers have tried to explain this conundrum, and all have different ideas. It sadly weakens the argument of using religious experience as a way of knowing God, but despite its wholes, I still believe it to be the keyway in which we can gain knowledge of God. This, however, is not the only way. One of the many other ways is through Natural Theology. Natural Theology is finding God through fact and experiences other than divine revelation. Let’s say you’re on a woodland walk, and its sunset, you proceed to sit on a bench and watch the sun go down, you feel a sense of divinity, belonging. Some would argue that to be experiencing God through nature. Others take a look at our world and use logic to deduce that God exists. That might seem like using reason to prove Gods existence, and it is, but it’s using experiences of our world to define this logic and reason. Paley and his analogy of the watch is my favourite example of natural theology; A watch is made of complicated parts, It must have had a designer, The world is made of complex parts, It must have had a designer, This designer has to be God. It is a simplistic system of looking at the world around us and deducing due to its immense complexity, that it just couldn’t be a coincidence. Another great example is strangely the views of Descartes. He believed that the world around us was a deception, and that are senses deceived us in every way, but that our mind was real. It had to be made by something greater, that greater being is God. This is an abstract view on natural theology, rather than looking outwards to our world, he looked inwards towards our bodies. I personally don’t agree with Descartes, because as I said previously, Aristotle's views on reality and our world are very similar to my personal opinion, so believing that everything is a deception is something I disagree with. I don’t understand the reason why it would be, and I also think the world around us is all we currently have to base our understanding on, so I feel it’s easier to believe it’s real. Speaking of Aristotle, he also had a very convincing argument on natural theology, the Unmoved Mover. He believed that cause and effect is all around us in our world, and using newtons 3rd law (every action has an equal and opposite reaction), we now know this to be true (that is true for us currently). He thought there had to be something that caused the first cause, and he said that to be the unmoved mover, which looking back on his philosophy was one of the first ideas of a God. I think that although natural theology is a more logical system of finding God than revealed theology, that it doesn’t have as much impact. The most direct way of obtaining knowledge of God is directly, and the most direct method of understanding we have is religious experience and revealed theology. Some believe that the bible is the most direct way to understand God, as it was written by people at the time of Jesus, and those stories show the divinity of God and portray his moral messages. Scripture has several issues, using the bible as an example, which for me, has far too many issues to take it at face value. Thomas Hobbes believed that language was key to understanding and communicating anything. One of the problems that I see with the Bible is there are millions of unique ways to interpret it, and this creates several different ways to understand it. So, which is right? Is there a correct way to interpret the Bible? This is a question we will never get the answer to because how we all understand language is through interpretation. This different interpretation is why there are so many religions and branches from these religions, they all believe their way of interpreting the bible is correct. This has lead to thousands of conflicts in the past and millions of innocent lives taken as a result of it. Surely a loving God would make the Bible, his message to humans a lot easier to understand and make all his morals clear and defined. Another problem is cherry picking. In the years during the Bibles creation, there was a team of people called the council. These people judged what was to go into the Bible. People would come with gospels and stories written about Jesus and God, and the council would judge whether it went into the Bible. The problem is that the council were only taking stories that made Jesus look holy, so stories of him maybe going to the market and buying food wouldn’t be included as they didn’t make him look divine enough. This just solidifies the untrustworthiness of the Bible. Surely the Bible should include everything that happened in Jesus’s life, even the boring stuff. If they have changed what went into the Bible, who’s to say they didn’t add some fake stories in there, to help make Jesus and God be perceived as more divine. The problem is some people don’t take the bible literally, whether the story is a lie or not, the moral message behind it is what matters and not the story itself. The story is just a vessel to get the morals across, like a Fable. I personally do agree with this, but then we can’t use the Bible as our only source of information for getting information on God, as if we don’t see what’s in the Bible to be true, then we can’t use it as our sole source of information. Contradictions are also a big downfall of the Bible and Scripture as a whole. The bible has two testaments, the old and the new. The old testament is the original bible, and has some less than modern views, for example; “An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth”, “If you do not have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one”, “no man should lie with a man as with a woman, it is detestable” and “A woman is to stay silent”. Then it contradicts these views with more widely accepted views in both the new testament and in the old testament; “turn the other cheek”, “By the grace of God I am what I am”, “She is worth far more than rubies”, and “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him”. These opposites are both in the same book, supposedly messages given by the same being, and an unchanging being for that matter. These contradictions make the bible less reliable as if you were to take all the information in there you would seeking revenge and yet being peaceful and allowing others to be whoever they like while hating them for it, with the possibility of seeking to kill them for it. Contradictions imply that either the stories put into the bible weren’t checked for contradictions, or that over the years people have been realising the views of the bible just aren’t as accepted, so adapted it. All of these problems apply to most other forms of scripture as well; the proverbs have contradictions and adaptations, the Torah could have issues during translation from Hebrew (for example God made the world in 7 days in the bible, but they have realised the translation is ‘time periods’ not days), the Qur’an has contradictions, has been edited and has so many interpretation issues, which have lead to several tragic events. All of this decreases the reliability of scripture, and means I don’t understand why people would use it as the only source of information for gaining knowledge of God when experiencing things is a much more personal way of gaining knowledge of God, opposed to reading a book. So to conclude, I personally disagree with the statement, as I think A posteriori knowledge is a much better way to gain knowledge of God, as opposed to A priori. Revealed and Natural theology are much better and more involved ways to gain knowledge of God. Natural theology is finding God through our world, using logic and reason (for example, Paley and his watch). I find this to be one of the most logical ways to gain knowledge of God, using what we have around us to deduce information about him. Religious experience is the core to religion and understanding God, this is when God reveals himself to you, through mainly religious experience. That is the most intimate way to gain knowledge of God, but the problem is not everyone can have these, and the few that do may write what they saw, but then we run into all the problems scripture has. Contradictions, different interpretation, translation issues, cherry picking, adaptation and possibly lies. These are the several reasons I don’t find scripture to be a reliable source of information, and why revealed and natural theology are the ways to go about finding out knowledge about our God.

I believe that Kantian ethics can be very useful when thinking about the ethics of business. His views on respecting other people’s autonomy could prove very useful in the treatment of workers, making sure everyone is treated fairly and each persons individuality is respected. The view of universal honesty would be enormously helpful in a world of false advertising and fake products, helping to keep companies honest and transparent and making life easier for consumers. Kantian ethics is a very deontological system, so in an ideal world, companies wouldn’t make any profit and sell products at cost, that way products would be made only because they will do good by people, rather than for a profit. Although this probably isn’t feasible, it would make the world a better place. Kantian ethics promotes the ideas of not using anyone as a means to an end, therefore Kantian ethics would be most in favour of all companies being co-operatives, where everyone isn’t only a stakeholder, but a shareholder too. This way people have less leverage over employees and they aren’t just used to aid the profit of the business, but they play a crucial role in the businesses function. Not only this but a truly Kantian business would have every employee with the same shares, same pay, and roles of equal importance. That way, bosses couldn’t have power over employees, and employees wouldn’t just be hired to help the business. I think Kantian ethics would fit best with both welfare capitalism and a free market, and I believe Friedman thinks in a very Kantian way. One of the biggest parts of Kantian ethics is to respect others autonomy. Everyone is unique and individual, and that should be respected by every other person. This shows that every person should be respected and has a right to be treated well. Some of these big companies have been reported to be using sweatshops, underpaying and abusing staff in order to maximise their profit, an example of this would be the Nike scandal of 1997, where Nike were accused of making some of their trainers in sweatshops in China in order to minimise production cost, and make more money in the long run. This is not only illegal, but also completely barbaric. In a Kantian view goes completely against the ideas of autonomy and individuality, not a single one of those workers has their individual rights accepted or even taken into account in the slightest. If they were following only this rule of Kantian ethics, sweatshops wouldn’t be a thing anymore, as each workers autonomy would be respected and overworked and poorly treated workers don’t fit into that regime. In fact all of the Kantian ethics rules don’t allow for any mistreatment of workers, especially in sweatshops. The categorical imperative, of what Kant theorised to be honesty would allow for this, as it is extremely unlikely that a company would be completely transparent about employee mistreatment on this scale (for example again with the Nike scandal, they denied the allegation throughout the scandal, even thought they turned out to be true). Following the ‘no one is a means to an end’ rule, using workers just to maximise profit would not fit into this, workers would have to have good rights, and good pay, so they aren’t being just being used, but they are playing an integral part of the business. In an ideal Kantian business, every worker would be payed exactly the same, have jobs of similar importance and all have equal shares within the business. This way no one has any leverage over anyone, meaning that no one can be used as a means to an end because they all play the same part in the company. Of course in a modern society, this wouldn’t be possible. Companies need CEO’s and directors to guide them in the write direction, and they need shelf packers and janitors to help them run. They may not seem as important as one another, but they both equally help a business thrive, just in different ways. But it would be entirely unfair if they were payed the same wage, as being a CEO is much more demanding both mentally and in hours worked. So as much as the ideal Kantian business won’t come into fruition anytime soon, we can take his views on autonomy, and use it to treat workers much better. The main aim of a business or a new product is to make profit, to make a product for a cheap as possible and sell it for the maximum amount of money people are willing to play. This wouldn’t work with Kantian ethics because the system has to be followed in a completely deontological manner. Deontological means actions are performed within themselves rather than with consideration to the outcome. The opposite is Teleological, where an action is performed entirely based on the actions outcome. All businesses and companies work teleologically. If Kantian ethics were to be followed, then all businesses would be purely deontological, it would no longer be about how much profit is being made but if a product is good, useful and aids the furthering of the human race. The only problem with that is, that although the outcome is much more positive, we still have to consider a profits outcome. Meaning although the system is more selflessly teleological, it would be impossible to have a deontological business, as everything done within one has an outcome which has to be considered. Another big thing for Kantian ethic is the categorical imperative, which he believed to be honesty. In a world of fake news and false advertising looking towards the truth wouldn’t do us any harm. If we were to follow Kant’s categorical imperative, all products would be sold as they were, which would be much more beneficial for a consumer, as we know what we are buying. It would be harmful to businesses though. Businesses rely on advertising and hype to sell products, even when they aren’t falsely advertised, they are made to look there best when in an advert. The problem is if they were completely honest they would sell less units and generate less profit, meaning as consumers we wouldn’t get as many good products, due to the lack of profit for businesses would use to make new product. I think false advertising should be banned, I understand that products are ‘dressed-up’ during an advert but when a product is completely different to what is shown, that’s just ridiculous. In our society today honesty is needed, there are too many lies and false things circulating, its almost like complete honesty is a foreign concept. I think the system that fits Kantian ethics best is communism, at least the idea of communism. The premise that everyone is equal and even would suit Kantian ethics is very well, as that way no one is used as a means to an end and everyone has any leverage over one another, because they’re all equal. Capitalism hinges on ownership of goods, which means that a few people have the power over businesses and economies, which doesn’t allow for people not to be used, as everyone below them is being used. Sadly a Kantian ethical view would be complete democracy, the problem with that is not everyone is as smart as each other. The general public can be quite naive and divided at times, so if in a business each person has the same say, there will always be conflicts, and the likelihood is no unanimous decisions would get made. The one thing Kantian ethics would take from capitalism is welfare capitalism, or specifically the welfare part. The welfare of workers is key in Kantian ethics as I discussed earlier, as allows for worker autonomy and company transparency. Kantian ethics would be in favour of a free market. It allows the consumer to have influence how much things cost, as we are the ones buying the product. It also means that businesses aren’t just using the consumer as a means to an end for profit, but that they are integral in the businesses survival. This also means government can’t interfere with selling or buying products, freeing products from monopolies and artificial scarcities, which don’t fit with Kantian ethics due to the power the government will have over these things. Milton Friedman is more Kantian than he lets on, in my personal opinion. He was a capitalist campaigner, which Kantian ethics doesn’t particularly allow for, but some of his views are very Kantian. For example, he believed that students should be given a voucher which allows them to go to any school fo their choosing. This completely encompasses the students autonomy, as they are given the soul independence to choose how they further their education. He also believed that government interference only ever lead to negatives, and was completely against monopolies and progressive tax. Monopolies give too much power to one company and the rich tend to find loop holes in taxes anyway. He proposed that government only interfere when absolutely necessary even and that we introduce a flat tax (just greater than the lowest bracket). This works towards making people more equal, which is very Kantian, as a flat tax allows everyone to give the same quantity. The lack of government interference means that the government has less power over businesses, and means there is less of one group of people influencing everything and more of lots of people influencing there own bit. In reality, the government is very involved in what is bought and sold into a country, especially this country, and they seem to be doing there job quite well. Everything is under control and works like clockwork from a consumer point of view. So, to conclude. Kantian ethics can be very helpful when thinking about business ethics. It promotes the welfare of workers and deters from the idea of sweatshops and underplayed employees, more equality within a business, less government involvement in the movement of products and resources, more honesty in advertising, more consumer say in how much a product costs and less focus on profit and more focus on whether a product will benefit society. In an ideal world a purely Kantian business would be excellent for both the consumer and the worker. All the workers would be equal in pay, job and shares held. The products made by a business would be sold at just above cost, in order to pay employee wages. The consumer would be informed about the products price, told how much the product cost to make and how much will be put towards paying workers, pure and complete transparency. There would be no mistreatment of workers, as all workers are equal so no one has any leverage over one another. Essentially it is very similar to a communist view on a business. But just like with communism, in reality that wouldn’t work. Businesses will never settle for any less than an enormous profit, the governments will interfere with product and resources movement, which is sometimes good but at other times disastrous. Workers will never all be totally equal, as businesses will always have bosses and ranks within their workforce. But what we can take from Kantian ethics is better treatment of workers, abolishment of sweatshops, and in general more honesty, because in a world of business lies, honesty wouldn’t go a miss.

I personally disagree with this statement, as I believe that although Natural law has several strengths, they our outweighed by its vast amount of weaknesses. Although today it still plays a huge role in our world, and is the basis of some of the UN’s peace talks, I feel it has become outdated and not truly applicable to today’s society. With the growing rise and acceptance in our culture of atheism, euthanasia, abortion, homosexuality, trans gender and diversity, it just doesn’t seem to fit, as it feels like natural law has very old fashioned view points and isn’t very accepting of different people or cultures (i.e no sexual or religious diversity). I also feel it is a predominately deontological idea, which is great in theory, but in reality, nowadays we think much more teleologically and selfishly. We often do actions so we can get something out of them, another reason why I don’t believe natural law has a place left in our modern society. Natural Law is belief in sacred moral laws, that are universal, eternal and absolute. Although Thomas Aquinas is best know for his theory of natural law, it dates back to ancient greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. Plato never spoke or wrote directly about natural law, but did have the idea that we lived in an ordered universe. He linked this back to his world of the forms, and said the form of the good leads a person in the direction of acting in an appropriate way. Moving on to Aristotle, who had the biggest influence on natural law (he was named by St Aquinas as “The Philosopher”). Aristotle is mainly associated with natural law due to his interpretation by St Thomas Aquinas, and how he influenced him to create his own ideas of natural law. In one of Aristotles works, Rhetorics, he stated that although everyone has their own particular law, which is set by themselves; he believed that there was a “common” law according to nature “For there really is, as every one to some extent divines, a natural justice and injustice that is binding on all men - Aristotle”. Then came the stoics, who are best known for taking the idea of natural justice and forming into more of a natural law. Aristotles’ idea of law could have appealed to what is emphatically natural or could have appealed to a divine positive legislation, whereas the stoic natural law was totally separate from nature and divine sources of law. They believed that there was a rational and purposeful order to our universe, and how rational living beings act according to this said law, is what they dubbed natural law. The stoics also believe that God was everywhere and within everyone, they said there was a “divine spark”, which made people act according to nature. Then along came Thomas Aquinas, who developed this idea into something wholeheartedly christian. Thomas Aquinas was an aristocratic monk and scholar, who aimed to use logic, reason and faith to prove that Christian views were true and valid. He devised what came to be know as the “Four Tiers of Law”; The tier was Eternal Law (the morals and morality of god, unchanged and eternal), then onto Divine Law (our understanding of the eternal law, through scripture and prayer), tier number 3 is the Natural Law (this is how we should behave according to the eternal law of God), and finally the Human Law (how we actually behave). He said that morality was out of our existence, and we all know what is right and wrong, but he also stated that Natural Law was what a person observes, but also what they know innately. Thomas then goes on to divide natural law into Five Primary Precepts; Preserve life, Ordered Society, Worship God, Education and Reproduction. This then divides further into Secondary Precepts, which are opinions and interpretations of the original and definite primary precepts. This is where complications start to arise as depending on how you interpret these primary precepts, you can state things such as “natural law says no to euthanasia, as it is stated that you should preserve life”, although this is never strictly said. Like I stated previously, I don’t believe that natural laws strengths outweigh its weaknesses. But it does still have its fair share of strengths. Natural law still plays a huge part in our society today, it is still a key role in the catholic church’s rules, and is still used by the U.N as parts of its talks and other parts of the UN, meaning that even after this many years, it still hold merit in several important factors of our society. A philosopher named Jeremy Bentham created the Doctrine of Utilitarianism and the principle of “the greatest happiness of the greatest number”, by using natural law this could be more easily achieved. If everyone, or at least lots of people, followed natural law then we would all be acting in a morally correct way, then that would benefit society greatly. This would mean that everyone was acting in a morally acceptable way towards one another, and therefore making society happier for a great number of people. Natural law, gives our world and the people in it purpose. Working towards natural law is said to be our telos, and once we reach that telos we gain eudomonia (satisfaction), which shows that natural law gives people and the world a sense of purpose and meaning. To me thats is a strength as it can often feel like we were a fluke of natural and it is often hard to define as humans why we are here, thats where natural law can help. Furthermore, you don’t need to believe in god to believe in natural law, as although Thomas Aquinas believed natural law was the eternal law created by god, natural law is more based off of empirical observations of nature. Natural law can provide independence too, natural law allows you to use your own reason and logic to determine what is right and wrong, so you don’t have to fully take the word of religious scripture or tradition, because Thomas Aquinas himself even said faith alone is not enough. The framework of natural law could be used to solve one of the generations biggest problems, how to control AI? Natural law is a system in which people do actions because they are good, and choose not to do bad, simply how we should act. So if you taught an AI Gods scriptures and everything we know about what eternal and natural law is and how it works, then it wouldn’t be a threat to us. The AI will do good actions and not commit evil ones, plus it will be doing them inherently because they are good within themselves. Therefore making the ideal person. This shows that even though natural law is centuries old, parts of it are still useful to use today, and to future generations. Moving towards the weaknesses. A lot of true believers in christianity would say that there is no reason or logic involved to believe in god, so the idea of using reason to follow god’s rules may be offensive to them. Thomas Aquinas also has two sides to him, the medieval monk, who would fall back and praise miracles and scripture, and the very modern ideas of logic and reason. So he seems to contradict himself a lot as a part of him has is very modern and a part of him that is for the time very normal. An example would be his views on Judaism, he said that jews should be treated as normal people, and that they have rights as well, but he may have tried to convert them to christianity, which he believed to be the only correct religion. Meaning that his views become harder to trust and often become confused, making them harder to believe in. Aquinas had a really positive view of human nature, expecting everybody’s natural response to be to do good, but that just isn’t the way things are, it’s impossible to be perfect and never do anything bad. It’s too naive and optimistic. Backing my point, Thomas Hobbes (writing at a time of civil war and execution of his king) had a much more pessimistic and destructive view of human nature “Men from their very birth, and naturally, scramble for everything they covet, and would have all the world, if they could, to fear and obey them”. In my eyes everyones point of view is shaped by what happens to them, what they experience. I think both of these points of view are too extreme, but I do believe that in general human nature leans more toward being teleological than deontological, favouring a more Hobbs style view, as people are never fully and truly selfless and good. Natural law is too fixed and unchanging and is predicated on the premise that the universe is intended or designed; which is a problem for atheists and scientist to believe, so although a belief in god isn’t required to believe in natural law, it definitely becomes harder. These were some smaller weaknesses with natural law but there are too much larger ones, which have the most weight to them. The first of which is that natural law may not be applicable in our modern day society, which I believe to be true. Things such as Worship God and Reproduction are all things done in our society today, but why should someone worship god if they are an atheist, and the secondary precept of Reproduction would imply no sex for pleasure, no homosexuality, no transgenders and no contraception, all of which are things that are widely acceptable in our modern culture. The primary precept Preserve Life, would suggest no to war and yes to peace, an approach that could be used today to sort out many of the worlds conflict, which is a positive point, but Thomas Aquinas also wrote the just war theory, stating that under certain circumstances war is morally acceptable. That is a contradiction within itself, because war can’t be morally acceptable if it is morally acceptable to preserve life, can it?. Preserve life could also be used to argue that abortions and euthenasia are wrong, but what if a girl gets pregnant at a young age and doesn’t have the support to raise the child, or if the child will grow up in abject poverty, surely then abortion would be the better option, to avoid the baby having a terrible life, would it not? And when does abortion become abortion, does the morning after pill count as abortion or does it have to be a certain way through the pregnancy before the baby is considered a baby. It seems that natural law isn’t applicable in todays society, as it seems to make more questions than answers. The second main counter argument is that natural law is a purely deontological system, whereas most people today don’t do acts without rewards. Richard Dawkins created the idea of the “Selfish gene theory” if we are nice to people it lowers our risk of conflict and increases our likelihood of survival. This shows that even on a primal level we think teleologically, which is another reason natural law wouldn’t fit in todays society. Nowadays we do things to see what we can get out of them, and rarely for the good of the other people. So to conclude. I personally disagree with the statement above, as although natural law does play a huge part in our society today and is the basis for the most of the catholic church’s rules, and that atheists and theists alike can chose to abide by it, I don’t believe that it fits into today's society. as with a growing number of atheists, we are less likely to believe in things that exists outside of our existence. Also with all the contradictions that Thomas Aquinas has and the fact that the secondary precepts are fully opinion based show that natural law creates more questions than it does answers, and with it being nearly a millennium old now, it doesn’t fit into our modern society as it did back then. And finally as a society we are becoming more selfish, doing good actions purely for the outcomes rather than for the basis of them being good, we are less likely to do something for no outcome because it is right, as a society we are becoming more teleological, so a deontological system like natural law isn’t as applicable as it once was.

I do believe that Swinburne’s view are the most logical way to approach religious experience. His approach has a very logic basis; religious experiences are very personal, so when someone suggests they have had one we have no real reason to not believe them. Of course Swinburne has taken into account the anomalies to the scenario, so that’s why he has a system of testing if the source telling us about the religious experience is reliable. After this there is no real reason to doubt the person on what they say, as the way things seem to us (ie how they seem to the person in hand) is a good guide to how they actually are. That was a paraphrased version of his principle of credulity, and before was a paraphrased version of his principle of testimony, these are the principles he uses to try and break down why a religious experience is real and whether or not it could be used in an aid to prove god’s existence. Others have tried to explain religious experience; Rudolph Otto with his references to worlds beyond ours (which is similar to Plato but doesn’t seem to be a logical way to explain religious experience), William James with his simple P.I.N.T system to prove religious experience (but that has its fair share of problems due to its simplicity, and these problems make it a less logical explanation), Schleiermacher’s who said we all had innate knowledge of the divine and that religious experience was self-authenticating (self-authenticating experiences are convenient but aren’t a logical approach to religious experience because then anyone could say anything and it would be proven true) and many other smaller philosophers ideas. Swinburne’s ideas obviously have more depth to them, and with this extra depth the logic becomes more obvious. Swinburne defined a religious experience as ‘…an experience which seems to the subject to be an experience of God (either of his just being there or doing or bringing about something) or of some other supernatural thing’. He doesn’t just define it as an experience of God, it is either of God or ‘some other supernatural thing’. Swinburne realised that a religious experience may not necessarily be of God, but of some higher being. This definition lead him onto his two famous principles, the principle of credulity and the principle of testimony. Credulity is ‘the willingness to believe’ so his principle in simple words is ‘what one perceives is probably so’ or ‘this is what I have experienced, and I have no reason to doubt myself, so the thing I have experienced must exist’. This then leads two the second of the principles, the principle of testimony. ‘We should believe what people say unless we can prove otherwise’. It is very hard to tell if someone is lying about something of such supernatural basis, so we should take what they say to be true until we can give evidence to prove that it isn’t. It is almost a system of innocent until proven guilty, which in the case of religious experience makes perfect sense. As experiences are so hard to prove, it makes more logical sense to take them as true until we can disprove it. Of course Swinburne doesn’t doubt that there are exceptions to the rule, as Bertrand Russel once said ‘There is no difference between a man who eats nothing and sees God and a man who drinks too much and sees snakes’ . Swinburne doesn’t personally believe this but does know that people may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol when they had the said experience, or may have just been genuinely mistaken due to mental health or old age, making them much less reliable. He knew he had to have a method of disproving so accounted for all the possible explanations, and he even accounted for unreliable sources of information. The only problem is, a liar could pass all of his tests. To believe in the principle of testimony, you have to believe that most people tell the truth, but in our modern society, lies are everywhere. With the rise of social media and the growing amounts of fake news, its seems less and less likely that the majority are truthful. It seems that the majority may lie rather than tell the truth, so Swinburne’s principe of testimony although a logical approach to religious experience, doesn’t seem to fit so well in our modern society. We are naturally less trusting and less inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt, which is inherently necessary for Swinburne’s approach. Although Swinburne has, in my opinion, the most logical way to approach religious experience, there are plenty of others. William James had a very simplistic approach to is, he used the anagram P.I.N.T to explain them; The P is for ‘Passive’ (God will happen to you), The I if for ‘Ineffable’ (The experience can’t be explained through words), The N is for ‘Noetic Quality’ (The experience causes you to gain knowledge you didn’t previously had), and the T is for ‘Transience’ (The experience won’t last long, but will have a long lasting effect on you). These are the four categories that defines an experience as a religious experience, the problem is all of these categories are very hard to prove. For example, if you go to a church to try and find God through prayer, and succeed, was that passive. It wasn’t God who came to you, you went to find God, so by James’s view, that’s not a religious experience. The problem is each category is quite vague and not very well described, leaving them open for debate, so on paper it looks like a logical system to prove religious experience but in practise it can get quite complex. Another example would be if you can fully remember the experience, and are describing it to your friend, to James that’s invalid as it doesn’t fit under the ineffable descriptor. Another thing is that James didn’t encounter for exceptions, ie people of old age, or untrustworthy sources. As per Bertrand Russel (quoted above) ‘There is no difference between a man who eats nothing and sees God and a man who drinks too much and sees snakes’. Schleiermacher said that religious experiences are self authenticating, ie there s no secondary evidence needed to prove it. Which is convenient but completely illogical, because as Caroline Franks Davis said, if a criminal was convicted a serious crime eye-witnesses would need to testify and cctv would need to be checked and much more. Well if we are looking at religious experiences as a possible way to prove the existence of God, then they are the upmost importance to us. So it makes no logical sense to just take them at face value and say there is no more evidence needed to prove this, because secondary evidence would be needed to help us believe said experience has happened. Another theory is Rudolph Otto’s ideas. He believed that religious experience was the most important thing in any religion. ‘There is no religion in which it does not live as he innermost core and without it no religion would be worthy of name’. He said what was central to religion was an ‘apprehension of the wholly other’, he called this ‘Numinous’. He said that every religious experience has three parts; Mysterium (mystery of the experience), Tremendum (because of the awe inspiring terror, you feel a sense of dread in the presence of the overwhelming being), Fascinans (drawn into the experience by a a strange fascination). While Rudolph’s statement may be, in my opinion, completely correct, it doesn’t have a way to prove if an experience is religious or not. Logically it does make sense to say that religious experience is key in religion itself, as without it your connection to God may be weaker. But what’s to say I see a figure in the distance and I feel all three of Otto’s key feelings, I think it is God, but it is afterwards proven that I was hallucinating due to tiredness. He, like James doesn’t handle expectations to his rule. A person have an experience that is mysterious, fascinating and awe inspiring without it being God. For example if I look at the stars in awe and fascination, curious of the mystery of space, that’s not necessarily an experience of ‘the wholly other’, its just an experience. Another problem is the terms; mystery, awe and fascination are very vague and hard to pin point, ie they aren’t very well defined and will mean different things to different people. This lessens the logic in Otto’s preposition as vaguely defined principles can lead to subjectivity and thus leading to confusion, meaning they aren’t very logical. So, to conclude. I believe Swinburne’s ideas are the most logical way to approach religious experience. Although generally, our society may be less truthful and trusting, the logic of Swinburne’s ideas still stands. Religious experience is very personal, so we should believe others on what they say until we can prove otherwise, rather than not believing until we can prove it is true. Religious experiences are very hard to prove, they are self-authenticating, personal and very difficult to describe experiences, so Swinburne quickly realised that they are much easier to disprove than to prove. Yes there are many other approaches to look at, but they all seem to have more loops, gaps and problems than Swinburne’s. They are either too vague (Otto’s principles and the over simplistic views of Schleiermacher) or too simplistic (James’ P.I.N.T analogy), leading to subjectivity and anomalies, making them far less logical than Swinburne’s ideas.

I personally believe this statement to be correct. I believe in the existence of hypothetical imperatives, as in short term goals or desires that we work towards. But I find it hard to believe in a life goal, a universal goal or maxim (life rule) we can put into every situation and our life goal is to find it out, I don’t understand why it should exist. Kant himself didn’t know what it was, so who’s he to say that it ever existed. Kantian ethics combined the universal and natural laws of science (ie for him, this meant the ideas of Copernicus and Newton), along with the universal and natural rights of freedom (ie for him, this meant the ideologies of Voltaire and Rousseau). It’s a heavily deontological system, every action is good or bad within itself, irrelevant of outcome. Kant states that the categorical imperative must be followed in a soul deontological way. The problem with Kant is you have to believe in morals, if not then most of Kant’s ideas are sadly completely useless. Using the terms outlined by the inverter of Situation Ethics, Joseph Fletcher (Antinomian, No moral compass, fully based on situation. Legalistic, fully based on morals and laws. Situationalist, somewhere in between the two). Let’s say your Antinomian, then you live your life by the day, making decisions with the information given at the time, meaning universal morals aren’t going to be on your radar, because to you, they just don’t exist. I myself am an antinomian, when a situation arises I take the info i have at the i me and do what i think is right then and there, with no moral compass, just what i think is right based on the situation. Using Hume as an argument, he stated that no one can ever actually know anything, this is what inspired Kant to focus on universal morals, in an attempt to prove Hume wrong, even though I believe Hume to be correct. When we say that a theory or idea has been proven, what do we really mean, what Hume is saying is that we never really know anything, its just what we see, hear, touch, taste or smell, what’s to say that’s correct? Hume took a view of Solipsism, he’s saying the external world is unsure, following the ideas of Descartes and Plato, what’s to say the real world is genuinely what we think it is? A confusing argument, but yet Kant was still very determined to argue against that by trying to find universal morals. The Categorical Imperative is a universal law, outside our experiences, outside our time and space, and unrelated to situation. Kant says in order for it two be followed you need to follow two principles; The formula of the end in itself, and The formula of the kingdom of ends. The formula of the end in itself, is the idea of never using someone as a means to an end, as in we cannot treat people without regarding there future life, integrity and capacity to free choices. Kant believed in respecting others autonomy and in order to do that you must never use people. I completely get the logic behind this, but i personally don’t think its possible to perform. Anytime you talk to somebody there is the possibility that you are using them as a means to an end, maybe to because you like talking to them and are selfishly enjoying the conversation, perhaps you want them to do you a favour later that day. Those are just a couple of examples. This ideology worked very well for Kant considering he wasn’t too concerned about having friends or family, and when the king called to him to make a speech he decided the only way he could handle the situation was to either to address the king as he would anyone else (in order to make sure he isn’t using him as a means to an end, by calling him king, he could have been attempting to suck up to him and therefore gain money from him) and be beheaded, use him as a means to an end or ignore the kings letters (the option that he picked). The formula of the kingdom of ends is the idea that the only way to correctly follow the categorical imperative is to fully believe that everyone is doing the same, to believe in that everyone believes what you believe to be the categorical imperative and is following it, almost in a kingdom where everyone has the same soul belief. The problem with this is, would it not be soon evident that this ideology of yours is incorrect. Let’s say your categorical imperative is truth, and thusly you believe everyone is consistently honest, and then your friends lie to you about something or someone. Would you then not be moved to re-examine your faith in the kingdom of ends. This formula seems to be to be a very fragile system, as it can easily be disproved and very few people will have the naïvety and the capacity for faith to imagine that everyone is following what you think, and it can be a little egotistical, to believe your categorical imperative is correct and everybody should follow said idea. The whole idea of everything above requires belief, almost like believing in God, without that belief then there’s no way you would work towards it. Kant’s best idea for the categorical imperative was truth, but this has so many problems to it. Yes personally I do believe that telling the truth is more moral than telling lies, but truth isn’t universal, lies are sometimes necessary. Kant even gave his own example full of flaws, His example was the friend and the axe murderer. Your friend is hiding from an axe murderer inside your house, this axe murderer happens to be quite polite, he come by and knocks on the door and asks whether your friend is the house. Kant says you should tell the murderer where your friend is, by sticking to the categorical imperative. As you can probably already see this example has several flaws. The main one being your friend dies, which for any sane person would seem completely immoral to get your friend killed. The argument Kant gives back to this is the argument fo autonomy, ie everyone is respected equally, so telling the axe murderer the truth is the right thing to do as if everyone is equal, everyone has an equal right to the truth. I completely disagree and take the view of Benjamin Constant in that ‘no one has a right to a truth that harms others’, and I’m also a big believer in loyalty. The idea of selling a friend down the river in order to eventually achieve the categorical imperative and fulfil my telos is ludicrous to me. It also contradicts one of Kant’s other views, he believed you should never use people as a means to an end. Surely by sending your friend down the river, you are technically gaining something from that action, ie moving closer to eudomonia, then technically your using your friend as a way to get to what you want. Kant is a smart man and once more has a counter to this argument, in that the categorical imperative must be followed in a  deontological manner, not concerning what outcome an action has but doing it purely because its right in the moment. Yet for Kant this may have been easier, as he had very little friends and family, so little loyalty to worry about and therefore could live by his own rules, but for the average person with a family and important friends, this just wouldn’t be feasible. On the other hand, you could take a Legalistic approach. If you are a Legalist you believe in moral code leading every action you perform. You live your life by a strict moral compass and rarely sway from the morals you live your life by. Also for legalist, there are universal moral laws. So the idea of the categorical imperative makes complete sense, as they already believe in universal moral laws, so the idea of a single universal law would seem very appealing and likely. Legalists believe that life can’t exists without some sort of underlying moral compass set in stone, so the categorical imperative would make a lot more sense. The kingdom of ends would also appeal to a legalist as they would believe that if these moral laws where universal and thus shared and followed by everybody. As for the end in itself, would once again very much appeal and be a given to a legalist, as never using anyone to an end would be a moral law followed by most legalists, as there aim is to use universal moral laws to be the best people they can be. The categorical imperative thus far has been quite mysterious in itself, but we do have an example of what it could be. Thomas Aquinas came up with the idea of natural law, which was a list of moral laws that were from God and universal to all people and situations. Although his moral laws were derived from scripture and religious teachings, but the idea was still there. A set of maxims or guiding principles that are universal, outside of our time and space and usable in every situation. Aquinas’ views were used by the Catholic Church for hundreds of years, and many Christians still believe in his views today. This just shows that a lot of people believe in universal moral laws, and follow them religiously, and have done for hundreds of years, so the idea of the categorical imperative already exists in several millions minds around the globe. Maybe its just a modern view that morals don’t exist, because we want an excuse to do wrong without consequences. So, to conclude. I still don’t personally believe the categorical imperative does or could exist. Using Joseph Fletchers terms, as an antinomian, I feel that morals aren’t feasible or real, every situation requires a unique view and thus a unique idea of what’s right and wrong according to the situation. I also think its naïve to think everyone is doing as you are (ie the kingdom of ends) and I personally think its virtuality impossible to never use people to an end (ie the end in itself). I understand the view of a Legalist or Kantian, ie that the categorical imperative exists and that moral universal laws are the way you should go about living life, but I personally have never been able to fully understand their ideas and thusly agree with this statement.

I personally believe that morally there is virtually no difference between not prolonging a life and deliberately ending one, similar to the views of A.C Grayling. I am pro voluntary euthanasia, like Richard Ottoway I believe people should have a say in the way they die, and like Bogarde I believe that sometimes euthanasia is the best option, I find it to be much more dignified than suicide. The way they died is irrelevant, the outcome is they died, in the context of the question. If a person comes to the doctor wishing for death, if the doctor believes it is best for them and grants there wishes it doesn’t matter if they’re aren’t prescribed any treatment or go through voluntary euthanasia, the moral outcome is the same, you aided in the taking of a life of a person who wished to die. I am a Situationalist, so I change my morals for most situations, this means I don’t really have a strict moral code to live by, due to this I feel like the right thing in both case is to take the life and the process in between isn’t particularly important and makes no difference to the moral outcome. Others, such as Aquinas believe that taking life is a grave sin and no matter what the circumstance, taking a life is never the moral option (in the case of Aquinas, one of the principles of natural law was “Preserve Life”, and thus Aquinas would have been enormously against euthanasia). Voluntary Euthanasia is defined as “When a person’s life is ended painlessly by a third party at their own request”, and Non-Treatment Decision is defined as “The decision medical professionals make to withhold/withdraw medical treatment or life support that is keeping a person alive because they aren’t going to get better or because the person has requests them to. It is also sometime referred to as Passive Euthanasia”. In both, a third party is doing an action which will result in the persons death, at their express request, and this is why I see no moral difference between the two actions. There is a reason that Non-Treatment Decision is sometimes called Passive Euthanasia, that is because on paper there is virtually no difference between voluntary euthanasia and this, and thus this is classified under the euthanasia umbrella. Richard Ottoway said it best in my opinion, giving facts and figures to support this, “People should have a say in the way they live, and yes, the way they die”. He gave facts about the elderly and how euthanasia would limit rates of illegal euthanasia and suicide. I completely agree with Ottoway, if we can accept death as an inevitable concept then we should be allowed to have a say in the way we die, it’s much more dignified to be euthanised than kill yourself through suicide. Joseph Fletchers views would be similar to mine. He was the inventor of Situation Ethics and believed that each individual situation required a different unique moral outlook. He was somewhere in-between an Antinomian (A person with absolutely no moral code of conduct) and a Legalist (A person with a strict and rigid code of conduct they live their life by). Fletcher believed that in having a loose code of conduct, ie a few morals you try to stick to in your life, individual to each person. But that actions are not right and wrong, until applied to a situation, for example killing isn’t right or wrong until put into a situation. Shooting someone in the head for absolutely no reason would be considered wrong, but put into the situation of euthanasia would be considered differently, whether that is right or wrong is up to the individual but I would believe is to be right. “Sometimes no life is better” said Fletcher, who was the president of ‘The Euthanasia Society of America’ which was renamed to ‘The Society for the Right to Die’ and he saw euthanasia as morally different. For Fletcher quality of life mattered more than life itself, he said life was a load of experiences waiting to happen, and in itself isn’t good or bad unless you or the people around you make it good or bad. In fact, Fletcher created a lot of requirements in order to have a good quality of life including; An IQ of above 20, self-control, a balance of rationality and feeling, changeability and concern for others to list a few. He believed that these were the minima requirements a person must meet to stand a good chance of having a good quality of life. People like J.S Mill and Jeremy Bentham wouldn’t see a moral difference between the two events. These were the founders of Act Utilitarianism, a philosophy built on bringing about the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Put into this context, if you requested to die, and your death brought about the greatest happiness for the greatest number compared to you still living, then the method in which you use to come to the conclusion doesn’t matter. It is the right thing to do as it will benefit more people. This could be perceived as a very clinical and at times horrible way to look at life, looking at people as units of matter apposed to actual people. These views are what made the communism of Marx and Mao go so horribly wrong, as they started to wipe out people they didn’t consider to be beneficial to the greater number. Obviously interpreted in this way these views can get very twisted very quickly but if looked at in a less clinical view, ie life is still a sacred thing but if someone request to die and they aren’t going to enjoy living, taking the life if it benefits them and those around them more than if said person was alive seems the wise option, the method of how you get there, whether it be through removal of treatment or administering a drug that painlessly allows them to drift away, the result is the persons wish is granted. Surely that’s the most important part, and the part that makes the action morally acceptable. However there is a complete flip-side to this argument. Natural Law is a set or moral rules created by a man named St Thomas Aquinas. He believed that there were moral rules and laws that were created by God and governed our universe, if followed they make you a morally good person. He believed that the word of God was best portrayed to us through scripture, and that Natural Law is what scripture is trying to relay to us. One of the key principles of Natural Law is “Preserve Life”. Thus Aquinas would be against euthanasia. Not only does Natural Law state that life is sacred, but according to Aquinas, we are made in the image of God, so when you end a life, you take away a gift given to you by God, which is completely immoral. Aquinas was a Christian and his Natural Law theory is still used and followed in the Catholic Church to this day, so the views on euthanasia from Aquinas would also be followed by most Catholics and some Christians. Another view from Aquinas is that euthanasia is cowardly, and that it shows you can’t take the burden life can be, it’s a copout. Aquinas would say life is an endurance test, full of good and bad, but you have to stick it out in order to have a better afterlife. I personally disagree with Aquinas’ opinion for multiple reasons. Firstly, an all loving God wouldn’t mind if you chose to die or live, if death gave you less suffering than living, surely he wouldn’t mind if you chose to die as all he would want to do is minimise your suffering, not force you to live a life of unhappiness. Secondly as I have said before, I don’t live by a strict moral code that I apply to all scenarios, so the idea of it being a grave sin to take a life doesn’t make sense to me, because it totally depends on the circumstances of the action. Thirdly, being made in the image of god doesn’t mean that it’s immoral to take lives. The correlation between us being made in Gods image and it being wrong to take the life of a creature made in Gods Image just doesn’t make sense. Does that mean the only thing with the power to take lives is God? What makes that anymore moral than a human taking a life. When God changed the water to blood, sent in the plagues to Egypt and killed their first borns in the story of Exodus, was that more or less moral than the battle of the somme or the holocaust. To some Christians and Aquinas, the first example would be alright, and the latter completely immoral, but in both scenario, several millions of innocent lives were lost. Just because some were taken by God, doesn’t make it anymore moral than a person doing the same. Let me ask you a question, which is more moral, a doctor taking a suffering mans life, who is begging for death, or God killing every first born child of the Egyptians because to teach them a lesson. I don’t know about you, but I think the prior is much more moral. So I don’t think you can have it both ways, you can’t say “Preserve Life”, and then say scripture is our best way to find our life morals to live by, when on several occasions, both God and Jesus killed several innocent people, and promote war and violence. Now Augustine does have a set of Laws know a the just war theory, where there are certain circumstances that taking life in war is morally acceptable. I don’t understand why the Catholic Church don’t make a set of rules where euthanasia is morally acceptable and just, rather than making it a blanked negative, when in some or most situations, it is the best option. Put succinctly by Ottoway once again, the reason the law on euthanasia isn’t getting changed is “Faith-Based Resistance”. So to conclude, I do not think that there is any moral difference between not acting to prolong a life and acting to end one. I’m a Situationalist and follow the views of a Joseph Fletcher. I don’t live my life by a moral code, I adapt my morals for different situations. An action for me isn’t right or wrong in itself, but depends on the situation it is placed into. So if someone is wishing to die, and it is genuinely what they want, then whether you remove there treatment or give someone an injection to allow them to peacefully drift off, it doesn’t matter, they are both morally good. I understand and appreciate the views of Aquinas and the Catholic Church in that life is a sacred thing, but I don’t agree that death is a cop out, if someone doesn’t want to live anymore they shouldn’t be forced to stick it out, just for the possibility of a better afterlife, surely a loving God wouldn’t force you to suffer. The reason we are yet to legalise euthanasia is the “Faith-Based Resistance” Ottoway mentioned. Religion doesn’t seem to allow for euthanasia for a multiple of reason, but if they were to be more open minded, like they have been with war and homosexuality, then maybe we could legalise euthanasia everywhere, and minimise the suffering of those who really don’t want to live. Giving them a dignified and peaceful way out.

Personally, I disagree with this statement. Plato's form of the good, and his world of the forms are well-crafted ideas for how our reality exists, but I don't believe them to be real. I feel Aristotle's Four Causes and his Prime Mover are a much more accurate way to describe the reality in which we live. Plato's idea was revolutionary for the time, he believed that this reality was a mere shadow of the true world, this world is known as ‘The World Of The Forms'. Plato said within this world there was a perfect form for everything. This, however, was not just limited to physical things, it included emotions and feeling such as; beauty, love and good. All the forms were perfect, but not all equal. Some were greater than others. The form of the good was said to underpin all other forms and enable us to understand them. It illuminates all the other forms in the upper world, the further away something is from the form of the good, the paler it becomes. He said our world and all of the things within it were just pale imperfect reflections of the forms, as they were far removed from the form of the good. Our souls visit the world of the forms before we are born and after we die. So in life when we see an object, we can identify it as something (e.g a book) because our soul came into contact with the perfect form of a book. When we discover something new, Plato says that we already know this innately, and all we are doing is recalling our seeing its perfect form in the upper world. Plato best showed this in an analogy about a cave. There are three people tied facing a wall with a fire behind them in a cave, sometimes people walk past the fire holding objects. The people see the shadow of the object on the wall in front and believe them to be the object. One day someone is set free from the cave and is released into the real world, where they see real objects and the sun and realize that the shadows were just shadows and not the objects themselves. The man then goes back into the cave to explain what he was seen, but the others act with hostility towards him, calling him mad and refusing to believe him. In this analogy, we are the cave-men, the cave us our world, the outside is the world of the forms and the sun is the form of the good (the fire is just an imitation of the form of the good). Plato believed this to be Socrates, his former teacher, a man Plato has written much about. He was the basis for much of Plato's important philosophies. He believed that Socrates had accessed true knowledge, and understood that the world was an imitation of the perfect world, and was trying to tell the world about his findings. Aristotle, however, was much more focused on our world, rather than other worlds. He believed the material world was purely real, so he created a system to answer the question of why things exist. He believed that the reason for anything coming to exist is down to four causes. The Material cause (what it is made out of), the Formal cause (the arrangement of that matter i.e its design), the Efficient Cause (the agency of change and motion i.e who/what made it), and finally the Final Cause (what is the end purpose of the object). Aristotle said that an object requires an answer to all four causes for an object to be an object. Aristotle differs from Plato as we can see, but they have similar ideas. They both believe in matter and form, but Plato believes the world of matter exists from the world of the forms. Whereas Aristotle believes the form of an object existed within the object itself (e.g the form of an apple exists within each apple, rather than within a separate world). Aristotle believed that every change must have been caused by a chain of event prior and that all items are in a state of constant change. So there must have been something that brought about the beginning of the change and movement we see things in today. "The series must start with something, since nothing can come from nothing - Aristotle". He realized there must be a common source of all change, that was immune to change itself, this he coined to be the "unmoved mover". He stated that this is eternal, unchanging, undying and to be the ultimate cause of the universe which began the chain reaction of the cause and effect we see in things today. He later changed it to "The Prime Mover", "There must be a mover which moves them, without being moved - Aristotle". Aristotle believed the Prime Mover not to be the efficient cause, but to be the telos, it moved things by attraction rather than by pushing. He referred to a milk bowl and a cat as an example, the milk attracts the cat without itself doing anything. Like Plato, Aristotle believed the Prime Mover to be perfect, and everything else to be imperfect, that's why things are attracted to it because they desire that perfection. To Aristotle, this was God, but not today's idea of God. He believed the Prime Mover not to be a creator (as he believed the universe never had a beginning), but rather a creator of motion. He also believed God to be completely transcendent, with no interest in our world what so ever. In addition, he stated that God would only be interested in himself, as a being of perfection would only create a perfect object of thought, meaning he would only think of himself. In my personal opinion, I much prefer Aristotle's way of thinking to Plato. I don't believe in the ideas of other realms and other worlds, as I think that this world is real within itself. I myself have a mainly A Posteriori way of thinking, I have to be able to use my senses to truly understand something, whereas Plato's ideas attack this by highlighting the flaw with empirical evidence. I personally don't believe that a perfect form of good exists, I rather believe that good is a very subjective matter. It depends on several things, such as circumstance and opinion. For there to be a perfect form of good, that would suggest a perfect for of evil, would it not? But evil is said to be imperfect and there can't be imperfect forms as all the forms are perfect. But then if there is a perfect form of good but no perfect form of evil, then how can you identify an action as evil? Plato's form of the good has too many things left unexplained for me to believe it is a way for us to explain our reality. Moreover, our soul knows exactly what the perfect good is, why would it allow us to act wrong. Plato would say we haven't recalled the form of good enough yet, but the form of good encompasses all other forms, logically it would be the most remembered out of all of the forms. Furthermore, to believe the world of the forms you have to use A Priori knowledge, which is said to be held in the soul and is based entirely on reasoning. But if we are using reasoning then we should be able to explain how our soul enters this upper world, or how long it gets there. Plato left this unexplained, which is another whole in his theory. Aristotle, on the other hand, uses concrete evidence to base his theory off, our world. Aristotle's four causes use A Priori and A Posteriori knowledge to explain how our world exists. He believed, as do I, that we find truth through evidence displayed to us within our world. He also believed in a God figure, the first cause, but not something that was caused, which again makes logical sense. Everything we see is changing and that change had to be caused by a change prior and so on until you arrive at the first change, which he deemed to be the Prime Mover. Another thing Aristotle stated was that an action which is right for one person may not be right for another, and that there was more than one “good life”. This is a far more realistic view of human actions, as it shows the subjectivity within an action. It is in my view wrong to reference one perfect form of good, when everyone's view of a perfect good would be different. This could be true for all of Plato's forms, where we all have our individual perfect view of things. To show that rights and wrong are subjective, I pose a problem. If a train was heading towards five people tied to a track, and a switch was in front of you, which if you pulled would change the train's course, making it head towards just one person. What would you do? What if I then said it was a baby, what would you say then? What if it was your mum? These questions will all have different answers, which show that rights and wrongs are subjective and relate to circumstance and opinion, if there were a perfect form of good, then we would all have the same answer to all these questions. Although, I do acknowledge that there are several counter-arguments to my views. The main one being Plato, who believes heavily in his idea of the world of the forms. He is seen as the main argument against Plato, as their views differ so greatly, even though Aristotle was Plato's student. Plato would disagree with opinions and differentiation, as he would say the people are recalling their innate knowledge incorrectly and that they haven't reached true knowledge, so they can't truly understand or comprehend the perfection of the world of the forms and the imperfection of this world. He would also remark on how even if told, we wouldn't want to know, as he believed that we as humans find comfort in ignorance. Another significantly similar opposer is Socrates. He believed that to understand reality we had to reach true knowledge, which he attempted to find in people by using Socratic dialogue. In which he would question people to narrow down how much a person actually knew. He was completely opposed to the idea that this reality was real, much as Plato would have (Plato was Socrates student, and unlike Plato and Aristotle, Mentee and Mentor saw eye to eye). There is a big flaw in the Socrates argument, Socrates never wrote anything down, so all we know about him is through Plato. Which could mean a variety of things, one of which being Socrates never existed and was just created by Plato so he could use him as a scapegoat for controversial ideas. Another being that Socrates was just a drunk who Plato was in love with, so he made him seem like one of the worlds most renowned philosophers. St Thomas Aquinas could be seen as either for or against my personal views, but I see him as opposed. He was one of the key founders of natural law, which entails the idea of universal rights and wrong. Whereas I believe that right and wrong is subjective and that there is no true definition to right or wrong, which opposed on of the main basis of his thinking. For example, he believes that preserving life is part of our natural law. What if you someone where to shoot your mum and you had the opportunity to kill him first, would you do it? According to Aquinas we should preserve life and let him live, but the fact we mostly think it would be right to kill this man shows that right and wrong doesn't have any basis and that they can be different for everyone. So to conclude, I believe that this statement is incorrect, as I believe in the thinking of A Posteriori rather than A Priori. A reality based off of Plato's form of the good is entirely based on A Priori knowledge. Whereas people like Aristotle and I realize two things; the first being that a thing as complex as good doesn't have one perfect form, it's a matter of opinion, what one may find right another may find tremendously wrong. The other is that the idea of another plain in which good lights all, isn't realistic in our modern society. Aristotle aims to prove that things exist within themselves, and that our world is the real world using his four cause argument and the Prime Mover, which I agree with to a much greater extent and what I believe is a way our modern reality can be much better explained by.

I believe this statement to be true. As a fan of Aristotle I see the logical reasoning in Aquinas’ arguments, as they are quite similar to Aristotles arguments. The several attempt to explain God using the Ontological argument all have big holes in then, and they preach to the choir. I personally don’t believe that I would put myself as a member of that choir. I believe Anselm’s ideas to have too many gaps in it. It doesn’t seem to make much sense to me as if I conceive of a God, a real God be superior to it as it really exists, but that doesn’t mean a real God does exist. Our mind can create several things both contingent and necessary, but it doesn’t mean that they exist. His idea that God existence is Analytical doesn’t have enough backing, because it is very hard for statements to be analytical without hard evidence and proof. Moving to Descartes, I agree with his idea that all babies are born with innate knowledge of a supremely perfect being (i.e God), but his analogy of the triangle is where he falls. His idea ends up showing that God is contingent on existence, meaning God isn’t necessary, and therefore isn’t supreme or necessary, making the very concept of God fall apart. This is just some of the reasons why I believe this statement to be true, but there are many more. Aquinas’s ideas, like I stated previously, are very similar to Aristotle. He created the Five Ways in order to prove Gods existence through A Posteriori methods (in this case, using perceived general qualities of the universe, rather than reason). His First Way was know as The Unmoved Mover, and was an attempt at understanding the physics of motion Pre-Newton. Things stay the same unless a force acts on them causing them to change or move and every moving object was set in motion by something. He believed this series of motion had to have a beginning, which was in his view God. This idea has taken a lot of inspiration from Aristotles Prime Mover, and this would be due to the fact that in Aquinas’ time, Aristotle was being rediscovered and Aquinas’ studied him, calling him ‘The Philosopher”. So Aquinas was a big fan of his work. Moving forward to Aquinas’ Second Way, The Uncaused Causer, which is wildly similar to the First Way, but states that cause and effect cannot infinity regress and there had to be first cause (ie God). “The Second way is from the nature of the ‘efficient cause’. In the world of sense we find there is an order of ‘efficient cause’”.
His Third Way was Contingency. He argued that the world was full of contingent beings as we all rely on something to exist, and something else brought us into existence. He believed God to be exempt from this, he is necessary. Nothing brought him into existence and he doesn’t require anything to exist. This brings us to his Fourth Way, The Gradation of Beings, something are worse than others. There has to be a maximum to base this off, so his logic states that the maximum of any genus is the cause of all in that genus. He said that there must be something that can be based off all beings, which is God. And his Fifth and final Way, Design. He said that most natural things work towards a goal or target, but most natural things lack knowledge. So logically have been directed by something in order to get to this goal (for example, an archer fires an arrow at a target. The arrows goal is the target, but it has to be fired by the archer in order to reach said target). There must be something directing everything to its end goal, and this is God. These are all of Aquinas’ Five Ways to explain God’s existence, and I believe these to be a more logical way to explain God’s existence. For one Cause and effect has to have a cause in order to cause an effect. So before everything existed, something had to cause existence. That thing would have to be of supreme power and knowledge, and God to me seems to fit that description pretty well. The main objection to this are that by only seeing the effect, we can’t determine the cause. This objection was proposed by David Hume, know as the ‘Scottish Sceptic’ and gave an example of a scale where we can only see one side. We know that the other side is heavier but we don’t know what makes it heavier or who put the weight there, so in terms of our world we would be ‘jumping to conclusions’ to say it was God who started all of this. I understand the logic behind the counter argument, but like I said before a being of such power and knowledge would logically have to be the first cause, and God fits that bill. Maybe one day we will find another scientific first cause, but until then God is the best thing we’ve got to a first cause. Its the same argument and counter argument for the Unmoved Mover. As for his fourth way, that to me makes the most logical sense out of all of his ways. We can tell if something is hot by comparing it to other hot things, so there must be a hottest thing that exists somewhere in order for us to compare objects hotness. Well we compare the perfection fo items, so there must be something truly perfect, same with strength, knowledge and love. So somewhere there must be an all-perfect, all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful being, which is as I’m sure you have guessed God. The counter argument is that in order to compare two hot objects, a purely hot object doesn’t exist. My own personal counter argument is that hotness is a man-made concept and one we can understand through science, whereas things like perfection, knowledge, love and power aren’t things we understand truly yet, everyone has a different view on love whereas everyone has the same view on heat. As for his fifth way, the design argument, I personally don’t agree with it as I believe that not all objects can know their purpose, as a pen’s purpose is to write, but it doesn’t know that, it needs someone else to help them with it. But as humans, we know our purpose and can get there ourselves, without guidance or assistance. Moreover modern science and biology is more often than not due to chance less so than purpose, as something have no purpose and other we just create purposes for, that doesn’t necessarily mean it has a purpose, all it has is a label. The Ontological argument is a whole different idea. It aims to use reason to prove that God exists, and many people have taken many different approaches to the idea. Anselm took the more logic based approach saying that God is which “That than which nothing greater can be conceived”. So an imaginary God would be inferior to a real existent God, so the concept of God is therefore surpassed by God himself. This is Anselm first version of the theory and had one major problem, posed by Gaunillo. If you conceive of the greatest possible Island, it doesn’t mean that it exists. Just because something can be conceived doesn’t conclusively show it exists. This is where Anselm created his second version of the theory. God is which nothing greater that can be conceived, Contingent being are inferior to Necessary ones, so therefore God must exist necessarily otherwise he wouldn’t be the greatest being. For Anselm a necessary being can’t fail to exist. So God has to exist, for him that’s an Analytical statement, it is true by definition. The final criticism is that our minds can always create something greater, and that greatness is a personal thing, if the greatest thing I can conceive is a pink flying unicorn, then it is highly unlikely that my dad would have the same idea of greatness. The next person to attempt to explain God was Descartes, he believed that we are all born with concepts of certain things and these are universally shared with humanity (one of these being God). He used a triangle to prove Gods existence. He said that the triangle was God and one of the angles is existence. Without said angle the triangle wouldn’t be a triangle, so existence is a part of God, so therefore God has to exist. The problem is the analogy is weak. For a start God isn’t a triangle, which sounds obvious but in terms of proving Gods existence you have to be specific. And secondly, this analogy would imply that God is contingent on existence, as he can’t exist without it, so he therefore isn’t necessary and therefore isn’t superior to us, so therefore isn’t the God we know. Then there are the more modern and more obscure points of view Norman Malcolm and Alvin Plantinga. Malcolm said that God has to exist and has to necessarily as he wasn’t brought into existence by anything, or Gods existence is impossible, as he can’t exist contingently. So given that God exists today, he must have existed for always and must exists necessarily. The main objection is there may be thing that don’t exist, but it doesn’t mean its impossible for them to exist, ie it makes no sense to say “sometimes there is a God and sometimes there isn’t”, but the statement “maybe there is a God and maybe there isn’t” can make logical sense. Finally Plantinga with his wacky theory of other worlds. He uses ‘Modal logic’ to question the idea of other worlds. In this infinite possibilities, there must be a being of ‘Maximal Greatness’, which in order to be maximally great would have to be necessary, ad being contingent wouldn’t make it purely great. The only way it couldn’t exist is if there was a contradiction to its existence (something that makes it illogical/incoherent as a concept), but in a universe of infinite possibilities there has to be a necessary God, which as it is necessary, would exist in all worlds. So God must exist and must do so necessarily. The main problem with this is you have to believe in other worlds, if you don’t the argument is null and void, but if you do it seems to make logical sense. And finally the man who is said to have crushed the ontological argument is Amanuel Kant. He said that existence is not a predicate (ie it doesn’t add anything or give us any additional information about the object we are talking about, if I say a pen is red and has a handle and it exists, that last piece of information doesn’t help us at all). When we say something exists we say that the concept, plus all its predicates has been actualised (there is at least one verifiable example of these predicates in real life). Whether or not God can be actualised is the issue, but adding exists to God doesn’t do that. So in his theory saying God exists doesn’t help us in any way, therefore killing the ontological argument. The only way around it is by saying Gods existence is different from ours and that necessary existence is a predicate, but a predicate only God can take. But that seems like a weak counter argument as for me a predicate has to be applicable to more than one thing. So to conclude, I believe that Aquinas’ five ways are much more successful in supporting Gods existence than any Ontological argument because his argument for me are much more fleshed out, and have a lot more philosophical backing behind them, and for me seem to make much more logical sense. Motion and cause and effect have to have started somewhere, whereas the greatest being that can be conceived doesn’t is different for everyone and doesn’t necessarily have to be God. Most things have a purpose and something has to lead them there, and there has to be something we are basing thing off of (e.g love, perfection, etc). Whereas saying God exists because a triangle has an angle seems to be much weaker and less logical reason behind it. The only thing I agree with is that God is necessary, and that it is impossible for him to not exist but the way Malcolm and Plantinga went about explaining it is wrong in my opinion. If God doesn’t exist today it doesn’t mean he didn’t exist yesterday, he is outside our time and space and beyond our comprehension and understanding, so nothing is impossible for him. And the idea of many world is great but as a person who thinks that isn’t true, his argument becomes null. Kant sums it up the best in my opinion, saying God exists gives us no additional information about him, as without actualisation that piece of information is irrelevant, Aquinas tried to actualise him, by showing that everything around us is caused by God, a predicate of God would be that he’s a causer, and then went on to actualise this predicate by showing that everything we see was caused by him. Therefore actualising him by giving real world examples of one of his predicates. He explains Gods existence in a way the ontological argument just failed to do, and that why I prefer his way of thinking.

I personally disagree with this statement but not completely. I think that the soul contains the body, matter and structure, but not that the soul can be described in terms of physical and material. However, I do think that the soul can be described through its interaction with the body. I believe that the mind and consciousness are a part of our material body, that we are not truly two, but as one. I believe that the mind can’t be explained in the ways of material language, but I do believe that it is connected to and part of our body, and it is what gives us our personality and uniqueness. I am very much a believer in the philosophical views of Aristotle, the mind and the body are inseparable and one can not work without the other. Without the soul or mind, our bodies would just be lumps of matter, and without a body, the soul would have no purpose. I am also a big believer in the idea of behaviourism, that every mental state is learned behaviours of bodies, to say I’m angry means that I am behaving in an angry way. I also believe in the ideas of B.F Skinner, his principle of reinforcement. Actions are based of consequences, if they are good we are likely to repeat the action, if not then the likelihood we will do it again decreases. I also support the ideas of Gilbert Ryle, as I believe that several people make the category error that causes, sensations and events are only mental or physical, but not both? If an action is mental doesn’t suggest that it is different from what I do as a whole, the mental, for me at least, is what causes the physical. Aristotle is my personal favourite philosopher, and has several views that I agree with. He believed that the soul animates the body, and without the soul, the body is just a big mass of material. The soul makes us who we are. He is simplified to a materialist, but isn’t as he never refers to the soul in a physics or chemistry way. He also didn’t see the separation of the soul and the body as complete. He used the idea of wax and a wax stamp. The shape made by the stamp is then inseparable from the wax, just as the soul and body are inseparable. These views may seem similar to mine, as I personally agree with most things Aristotle said about the soul. Aristotle also believed that the soul wasn’t the soul alone and that it contained the matter and structure of the body, along with its functions and capabilities, again which I agree with. But then he goes on to say that the soul can be explained purely using natural terms, which I only semi agree with. Not in terms of the physical and natural but equally not in terms of the supernatural. I believe the only way the soul can be explained is how it interacts with the body. Then my views of the soul itself change, where I start to lean more towards the philosophical idea of plato. Plato believed that the soul was broken into three sections; Reason, Emotion and Appetite. Reason is the superior section, it gains knowledge, understands the forms and knows right and wrongs. Emotion, allows us to love and inspires acts of courage, but if unchecked can be reckless. And finally Appetite, encouraging us to look after physical body, but if unchecked leads us into a life of hedonism and become no better than animals. He likened it to a charioteer and his horses, the charioteer is reason and the horses are emotion and appetite. The charioteer controls both the horses, but if one of the horses start to gain speed, the charioteer loses control and the horse detaches from the chariot. The soul becomes split and the horse (either emotion or appetite) takes over. In my personal opinion, I think this is correct. As I believe that we can have animal instincts that take over, but that reason tries to control us. I begin to disagree with Plato when he stated that the soul is immortal and indestructible, as I believe it dies with us when we die. Plato also stated that the soul was simple and wasn’t made up of parts, this I do believe as the soul is just a singular thing, without parts or cogs or anything like that, it is a singular substance. This references back to Aristotle as he referred to the soul as a ‘substance’ (the ‘essence’ or ‘real thing’ of something), which he said never changed in terms of identifying us, unlike the body which changes all the time. The substance of our body is the soul. 
This refers back to the question in hand. Plato uses supernatural explanation to explain the soul, whereas Aristotle approaches it in a more physical and worldly based way, which I believe to be more correct. This is just one way of looking at the question, there are several more. A philosopher named René Decartes had a very different viewpoint. He disregarded all other philosophers and started with a completely blank slate. He believed that the sense experiences we feel on a day to day basis could be misled by demons, so he believed that the material world, including our bodies, could be an illusion. Within this doubtful and misleading world there was one thing that was certain, the Cognito or the mind “I think, therefore I am”. I see René as an idealist, where he believed nothing actually existed except for our minds. The way René describes the material world as doubtful and the mind as certain, suggests that the mind can’t be described in material or physical terms (if the mind could be described using material terms, it would no longer be certain). This view on life led him to a natural split, between the physical and the mental. He was a substance dualist, so he believed that the mind and the body were wholly different. He did make an attempt to link the body and the mind, trying to say that the mind is linked to our penal gland in the brain, which was responsible for common sense and imagination. This was an attempt to discuss the mind and consciousness through interactions, but was in my view, a feeble attempt as he never described how the connection actually worked, and we know that the penal gland is responsible for dreams not imagination. René Decartes was an idealist, whereas Antony Flew took a very different approach. Antony Flew was a materialist, he believed that everything can be broken down into the material it is made from. He said that the idea of the soul outliving the body was absurd. He compared this to a famous picture of the Cheshire Cat (Alice and Wonderland), where the cat disappears leaving his smile behind. “The absurdity arrises from the fact that the ‘grin’ is not a word for a substance”. He said that to talk about a smile without the face that goes with it, was ridiculous as without the face the smile can’t exist. Relating this to the soul and body, he believed that to refer to the soul is to refer to the body of the person. He was a pure materialist, only the physical person and nothing more. Antony is an example of how you can talk about the mind and consciousness purely though material terms. Personally I don’t agree, as I believe that the soul is something indescribable using physical terms, and that the analogy of the smile is a little ridiculous as although it helps to back up the idea the soul can’t exist without the body, which I believe, it also doesn’t make much sense. Just because we can not see the face, doesn’t mean that the face isn’t there, the grin could still be attached to the face, we just don’t know it. Moreover, the Cheshire Cat doesn’t exist and could never exist, so basing a whole philosophical argument off of a fictional and magical character isn’t the most stable basis. The final and slightly out there view is the view of Richard Dawkins. He believed that there were two souls, the soul of religion and the soul of science. He was a huge atheist so didn’t believe that the religious soul existed. But he did believe that in the years to come, we can use reason and science to describe soul two, and the religious soul will be proven to not exist. This is an unusual opinion as it uses reason and logic to prove the soul. So it shows that using physical and material knowledge the soul might be one day fully explained to us. I personally don’t agree as I believe there is only one soul, whether that’s the religious soul or the soul of science I don’t know, but I believe that the soul will remain unexplained. A thing that will be left unsolved. The soul although simple, is beyond human understanding, because we don’t need to understand it, we need to know it there and that it is a part of us and that’s all. So to conclude. I personally believe that the soul is part of our body, I’m a monist. I also believe in several of the views of Aristotle, how he believes that the soul animates the body and without it we would just be a lump of material and matter. I believe that the soul dies with us, as I think that the soul living without the body gives it no purpose, and therefore it has no need to exist. I believe that you cannot describe the mind and consciousness using material or physical language or in a worldly way. That’s why I favour Plato’s ideas of describing the soul, as I think there is no way to describe without going into the supernatural. I do believe however that you can use the ideas of behaviourism and BF skinner to show how our behaviour is influenced. Moreover, I believe that the soul is best explained through how it interacts with out body, how it animates us and makes us who we are. The ideas of René I could never get behind. As I believe that the soul and body are one and that the world is certainly real, so his dualist and idealist ideas are crazy to me. I agree with Antony Flew in that the soul outliving the body is absurd, and disagree with Plato’s ideas of the souls immortality. But I don’t understand Antony Flews materialist ways. The physical person is a part of us as a person, but not all, it seems too coincidental for our body to be fully self working. We need a driving force in the background, that makes us who we are, and makes everyone different. Something that isn’t part of our physical body, but is part of us. The soul is far to complex for us as humans to put into physical and material terms, the closest we can get to describing it is through the way it interacts with our physical body, so no I don’t agree with that we can describe the mind and the consciousness through physical, material and interactive terms.

I personally agree with this statement. God can‘t be omnibenevolent while evil exists. There are several theodicies and ideas however, that allow for a omnibenevolent God and try to put convincing arguments for the problem of evil. Augustine with his soul deciding theodicy (the idea of the fall of man and the fall of the angels), Ireneaus’ with his soul making theodicy (we are made in gods image and need to grow into his likeness, ie we start as naive children and thusly do evil, but when we grow up we grow closer to god and realise the true sin evil is) and John Hick with his idea of epistemic distance (God intentionally distances himself from us, to let us bring ourself closer to him and build a genuine relationship with him). There are also my own personal ideas, for example God is omnipotent, and thus can overcome all paradox’s so this shouldn't even be a problem, but even if we remove this predicate of God. All loving doesn’t necessarily mean all good, as in sometimes being loving means that sometimes you have to do bad or in Gods case, evil. Without that we don’t realise the good as well as we do after the evil and sometimes evil is needed for people to see things differently, sometimes evil can do a lot of good for people in the long run. Augustines ideas are much more complex than I stated earlier. Augustine says that we genuinely have free will, and that God gave us this free will in order to make this free choice to follow god and do good or take the road of evil and sin. Augustine calls this ‘Voluntas’. Augustine argues that a person who does the worst evil is better than a puppet made to good. I completely agree with this statement, I believe that free will is the most important thing in our universe. The ability to make free choices is more than the greatest gift anyone could give us. I believe after what happened with the angels and Lucifer, God realised that even without free will, evil will still find a way to effect the system, so giving us free will allows for the evil, but also allows for the blossoming of good. As Augustine said, everyone has ‘gifts’, even when people use them for bad, that’s better than people not having them at all. Augustine uses two passages from the bible to explain why a world that was originally made in complete goodness, has evil within it. He uses what he calls the two falls; the fall of man and the fall of the angels. The fall of man, is the story of Genesis 3:6, the story of Adam and Eve (the snake tempting Eve to take the fruit and then Adam and Eve both eat the fruit, and God as punishment removes them from the garden). The fall of the angels, is the story of Ezekiel 28 and Isaiah 14, how Lucifer became satan (one angel (Lucifer), gained free will and gathered a group of angels, and they all made the conclusion to disobey God, so God as punishment banished them from heaven to hell). Augustine splits evil into two categories; moral evil and natural evil. Moral evil is due to Adam and Eve, and the fact that evil is ‘in the loins of Adam’, means that every human has the ability to do evil (eg, Murder). Natural evil is disorder that was brought to the universe by the fall of the angels and the fall of man (eg, A hurricane that destroys a whole village). There is some serious problems with Augustines theodicy sadly. The main one being, Gods omniscience. If God is omniscient, he knows everything that has happened and will happen, meaning he would have know about Lucifer disobeying him and Eve taking the fruit off of the tree. Surely an omnibenevolent God, knowing this would lead the release of evil into our world, he would have wanted to stop it? If I know my friend is planning to murder someone and then does, it’s not necessarily to blame for the murder, but I am solely responsible for not attempting to stop it. In the terms of God, God is omnipotent and omnipresent, so had the strength and knowledge to stop evil coming into the world, so he had to have made an active choice to not stop it. That surely means he isn’t all loving, if he was all loving then there wouldn’t have even been a choice, he would have never aloud evil to come anywhere near our existence. God was the only one with the capability to stop evil, so evil coming into the world can fall back onto his head, therefore putting a dent in his all-loving trait. The counter argument to this is the idea that evil needs to exist, without it we wouldn’t be able to truly appreciate good, and without it good would just be the norm, thusly meaning good wouldn’t be good, it would just be normal. I do personally believe this, as life is like a wave, with ups and down, but that’s what makes the good parts so good, and what makes life interesting. There is another problem that relates to Gods omniscience, he made hell. He banished Lucifer to hell, a place that he had created prior to Lucifer disobeying God. Doesn’t this solidify that God knew Lucifer would disobey him, as he created a realm of pure evil to banish him too, and to banish others too. This means that not only did he pre-emptively prepare for evil to enter the world, but he also had already made a realm of suffering and evil. This is a solid argument against Gods omnibenevolence, not only is he responding evil with evil, but he is also the original one to have made evil, as he made hell and hell came before Lucifer. I personally don’t believe in God being omnibenevolent, because if God never punished anyone we would never learn that doing wrong is wrong, and without that all humans would do whatever they want and fall into anarchy. God set out rules for us to follow, and if we go against them in a sinful way, we did the action so have the right to suffer the consequence of said action. The Irenaen theodicy is a very different approach to the problem of evil. Irenaeus based his theodicy off of a singular bible quote, Genesis 1:26, ‘Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness’. Obviously the ‘our’ here is referring to God. Irenaeus believes that we are made in the image of God, but that we need to grow into the likeness of God. Just like Augustine, Irenaeus does refer to the story if Adam and Eve, but unlike Augustine it does not play a key part in his theodicy. He believes that Adam and Eve were naive and immature in the beginning, and thus disobeyed God. He sees this event as the growing up of humanity as a whole. He believes we start out as naive children and as life goes on, grow up into the likeness of God, learning from past mistakes. Irenaeus in other words is saying that we start off sinful and it’s our job to grow into the likeness of god and become good. Surely the problem with this is that God created us with the capacity to sin, and told us it was our job to make ourselves into better people, if God loved us then he wouldn’t make us be better, he would just make us perfect, so that suffering and evil doesn’t exist. If you are all loving why would you want to allow suffering or evil into a world of the being you love so much. For example, I love my mother, so I would never want harm or anything of suffering to come to her, even if she was a better person for it. The counter for this would be that if you love somebody you do what you know is best for them, even if at the time it seems evil or bad. But at the same time, I don’t understand why you would make someone intentionally suffer just because in the long run it will do them good. Another problem with Irenaeus in my opinion is surely the possibility of future ‘spiritual perfection’ doesn’t in the slightest make up for the possibility of immense suffering in your life you have to go through first. Surely an all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful God would have realised this, known he didn’t want is creation to suffer immensely and rectified this flaw. Another man who relates into Irenaeus’ ideas is John Hick. He believed in the idea of Epistemic Distance. God intentionally distances himself from us, so that we can grow closer to him off of our own volition. He once again believes we are made in Gods image (we have to potential to be ‘intelligent and religious animals’, but we are put on this earth in our current state so that we can evolve ourselves) and likeness (humans attain ‘spiritual maturity and are one with God’, so evil has to exist to challenge us to develop into Gods likeness). Hick believes we were given the choice to love God, so that if we choose to love him, our love would be genuine. Once more this doesn’t make sense to me, surely if God loved us so much, he wouldn’t distance himself from us, he would be a vital part of our universe so he could make sure we were doing ok, not create us and then leave us to our own devices. The counter to this is if God intervened we would no longer have free will, and then this branches off into a whole argument about the illusion of free will versus actual free will. The point that I am making is that, God can’t be all loving and then sit by knowing he could intervene and stop evil, but then not. JL Mackie put forward a very good idea. Surely God could give us free will, but then get us to freely choose to do only good. Which at first sounds like not only God taking away our free will but also sounds impossible. Yet God is omnipotent and able to overcome all paradox’s, so creating this new sort of free will would be no problem for him whatsoever. I believe this would make the most sense, as God would then not have to worry about evil infesting out world, because we would all be doing good actions. I feel like this is a good counter argument to both theodicies, but that in practise it wouldn’t work, as I believe we need evil in the world to teach us the right from the wrong and make us appreciate good even more. Gnosticism is a religious view that all matter is evil, and that God cannot be responsible for matter because God is wholly good. Moreover they expand this to mean that Jesus can’t exists, because Jesus had a physical body (which due to it being made of matter makes it evil), which makes a derivative of God evil and that couldn’t work because all parts of God are wholly good. Well if God didn’t create matter, and isn’t responsible for matter, and thus wouldn’t intervene with our world because its evil, then what would the point of God even be. That’s like me saying I have a pen, but it doesn’t write, you can’t use or see it ever, unless you die, then there isn’t really a point to the pen. Also if matter is evil and God can’t be responsible for it, who is? Maybe the Big Bang made matter, but then who is responsible for the Big Bang? Gnosticism has too many holes in the theory for me to believe it is worthy of attempting to solve the problem of evil. So, to conclude. I don’t believe the problem of evil can be solved if we keep looking at God as omnibenevolent. As Augustine said, there are some key events in the history or Christianity that show where evil came into our universe. And yet Gods omniscience would have know these events where coming and instead of stopping them, he prepared a place of pure evil for them, which to me doesn’t exactly show his all loving side. As Irenaeus and Hick said, God made us bad, and then we have to grow into good people, but he could have just made us good in the first place. And distancing himself from us, and allowing us to come to him isn’t something an all loving being would do, just sitting from the sidelines as we evil and suffering parade our world, and doing nothing about it. Mackie’s idea of freely choosing to do good seems great, but God chose not to do that, even though he could have over come the paradox and made the world wholly good. I personally don’t think not having an omnibenevolent God is a bad thing, it means we get rewarded for our good actions and punished for our bad ones. And it means evil and suffering does exist, but at times they can be necessary, to show us how good the good really was and can be, and after all, a life without evil would just be plain boring. Life is currently like a waves of ups and downs, without evil it would just be a dull straight line, which in my opinion would be worse than the situation we have currently.

I personally believe that utilitarianism, mainly that of R.M. Hare to be a brilliant guide to navigating sexual ethics. Mainly due to R.M. Hare’s revision and combination of the utilitarian theories of Jeremy Bentham’s Act Utilitarianism and Henry Sidgwick’s Rule Utilitarianism. However, I would combine this with the intersectional feminist view of making sure that catering for all walks of life needs to be a separate and distinct issue. While I prefer the combination of utilitarianism and intersectional feminism, I can and do see the appeal for theories such as Joesph Fletchers Situation Ethics as I feel it’s focus on love and apagé would be a very useful guiding force to have when making decisions on sexual ethics along with its wildly universal and malleable nature you can craft it to suit you as an individual, and St Thomas Aquinas’ Natural Law as it provides a convenient and easy to follow rule set, which would be appealing to someone looking for a strong guiding force in debates surrounding sexual ethics. As I said previously, I think R.M. Hares utilitarianism is the most useful in regards to sexual ethics. R.M. Hare created what is know as Two-Level Utilitarianism where he combines the system of Bentham’s Act utilitarianism and Sidgwick’s Rule Utilitarianism. He said that we are all one of the two at any given moment. He created to characters that would fit these almost polar opposites. The Archangel being the logical and information based side of you, working solely off of unbiased factual knowledge and coming to moral conclusions using reason. The Prole is the more human side of you, a side that will make split second decisions based off of emotion and feeling rather than facts and statistics, it is viable to bias and emotional sway but it is the more heartfelt part of a person. In regards to sexual ethics having this split is very useful. It allows you to follow the utilitarian views of maximising happiness and living according to the hedonic calculus but it also allows for a more human side, who may understand the mistake of having extra-martial sex, or going against your countries laws against homosexuality because you believe it to be wholeheartedly wrong. In regards to same-sex couples, the archangel can be used to be an inner channeling of Bentham’s wild acceptance of all people. He believed if something can suffer, it deserves respect, protection and rights. For his time this was a seriously modern and often disliked view, but he believed it was correct so stood by it. Applying this view to the idea of same-sex civil partnership and marriages makes for a much more accepting and modern world. You may think that in the modern society we live in that homosexuality is accepted and celebrated, but in some middle-eastern countries it is still against the law. The archangel can take the unbiased facts from all the countries that have legalised homosexuality, look at the facts and figures regarding how much happier the society was for it and apply this unbiased moral knowledge, along with the utilitarian mantra of maximising happiness for the greatest number and campaign for the global legalisation and celebration of same-sex union. This refers back to intersectional feminism, they campaign for equal rights for all and fight for revolutions if this is not the case. Yet not in such a violent and demeaning way as some radical feminist groups have recently, they take it just as far as it needs to go. Combining the unbiased moral knowledge of the archangel and intersectional feminist views would make a coherent, logical and sound argument in regards to the decision of global legalisation of homosexuality.
Two-Level Utilitarianism combined with intersectional feminism is so much more applicable and broader than this. Take extra-marital sex for example, using the archangel to think logically that in having an affair more parties will be hurt, namely the partner and the person who is on the receiving end of the affair. Moreover, J.S. Mill would also highlight that sex although necessary is a lower pleasure, which can not only be delivered from your marital partner, but also does not out way the higher pleasure of true love. Combine this with the proles view of emotion and feeling, which would logically be that to hurt your marital partner just for sex only causes them sadness and upset so it isn’t worth it. Finally adding on the intersectional feminist view, that to cheat on what statistics would show to be a woman over a man (although it does happen), would not only be demeaning to both parties involved as your just using the person your having an affair with for sex, but your also treating your partner poorly. All of this combines to make a pretty logical argument against extra-marital sex, which I believe to be wrong, and using facts, morals and feminism I have shown why I think this is the case. I also think other forms of Utilitarianism are useful when it comes to sexual ethics, take Karl Popper’s Negative Utilitarianism. Taking the view of minimising suffering over maximising happiness would solve so many sex related ethical problems. In order to minimise suffering, you would allow same-sex unions and marriages, along with making women equal to men. This would minimise the suffering of well over half the world’s population have no negative effect on those this who aren’t involved. When applied to an issue such as extra-marital sex, having an affair is going to eventually cause the suffering of your partner, the person your having the affair with, any children involved, and even leave a huge mound of suffering on your own doorstep. Thus extra-marital sex isn’t necessary or worthwhile. The simplicity of Karl Popper’s theory makes is so widely applicable to any situation. All of these examples just show how you can use utilitarianism to be a brilliant guide in the world of sexual ethics. The combination of utilitarianism is a brilliant guide and in my opinion, the one I would use when making decisions about sexual ethics there are other theories which I find appealing. Joseph Fletcher created what is know as Situation Ethics, and it aimed to make life much more person-centred. It focuses around agapé, which roughly translates from the Greek as brotherly love. Providing in any given situation that you make sure that love is at the for front of your mind and that you made the decision you truly believed was the most loving then it is ok. That is what’s considered a good action in situation ethics. The problem I find with this is, on a topic as subjective as sexual ethics, it is very unlikely you are going to agree fully with anyone. What I mean by this is situation ethics doesn’t have enough of a code or a rule set to be applied to subjective topics. You can use the idea of the archangel in government to make decisions about the future of a countries laws and opinions on sex. You can’t do that with situation ethics and governments can’t think situationally, they have to think factually and broadly, think tens of years into the future. For the average everyday person however, situation ethics would be very useful as it would minimise the level of suffering you gave to people and in general, if you were a good person make you more accepting and loving. The crux however hinges on if you are a good person. Utilitarianism tells you to maximise happiness, Fletcher tells you to do what you think is most loving. Hitler thought he was loving the German’s and helping them by murdering the Jews but with the benefit of heinsight we realise this to be horrifically incorrect. Natural law in my opinion is more appealing. It gives you a set of simple, memorable rules to live your life by and if you do the this makes you a good person. According to St Thomas Aquinas natural law is how we should act in accordance with the human interpretation of the word of God, ie the Bible. The simple rule set does make it easy to follow, its almost a responsibility shift, if you aren’t sure what to think, Natural Law can tell you what to think. Natural law however suffers from two main problems, the rules themselves and how blanket they are. Their is no room for manoeuvre, even Pope Francis is struggling to follow them. For example, the Bible states that “though shall not lie with a man as with a woman, it is detestable”, yet Pope Francis has come out publicly in support of the LGBTQ community and said that they are “children of God”. Natural Law’s rules are outdated and nowadays regarded as a prehistoric approach to sexual ethics. If the rules were to be freshened up, and made to fit into a more modern society, then Natural Law would be much more appealing. Living life by a rule set is vastly easier than creating them yourself, or having to form opinions on your own. However as the Bible is seen as the word of God, holy and divine it will never be adapted and thus Natural law will soon be forgotten in the argument of sexual ethics, and that’s why Utilitarianism so much more applicable and useful.

I personally disagree with this statement. I believe that conscience isn’t related to God in any way, it’s the voice of reason within us. It decided what decisions we make and its word is final, it can sometimes choose wrong, but that would be because your reasoning for the action is wrong, or you know it is wrong but you’re driven by certain prime-evil desire. It’s responsible for Guilt as well, making us feel bad for making a decision based of what we know to be wrong. Aquinas believed our conscience is driven by Ratio, his word for reason. He stated that we need to use Ratio to align ourselves with Natural Law, but also stated that if we don’t come to this conclusion we needed to readjust our Ratio. Freud believed that our conscience has a whole undergrowth that we can’t control, a mixture of the ID (prime-evil desires), Ego (control of these desires), and the Super Ego (following the rules of society). I agree with Freud in that we have a huge subconscious mind, but also agree with Aquinas in that we are driven mostly by reasons. I think it to be a combination of subconscious and reason constantly battling it out and which ever wins will result in us making a decision. John Henry Newman believed that conscience is our best way to understand Jesus and God. He stated that “Conscience is the aboriginal Vicar of Christ”. I completely disagree with this, if God was our conscience then surely no one would reach the decision that it makes more sense to not believe in him. Aquinas is a strange party regarding conscience. He is both a modern thinker and a very old fashioned Christian when it comes to this. His modern side is what I agree with, he stated that we have a subconscious mind and things inside our own head that even we don’t understand. Combining this with his view that it is not God that works within us, but a force of Reason that allows us to do good actions. He also goes on to speak about synderesis which is almost a form of habit that pushes us to do good. He says with cultivation from the Ratio then synderesis will become habitual and always cause us to chose good action over sensuality (our temptation towards doing evil actions). This for the time period he was living in and how involved he was in the church is an extremely radical and modern view to take. He allows us to use our own minds to reach our own conclusions rather than just do what the Bible and the word of God instructs us to do. This is the part of Aquinas I agree with. The idea of subconsciousness in the mind I am a big believer in as I don’t think that we know all of our own minds, even down to our own thought. There is a phenomenon called intrusive thought, which are thoughts you had no intention of thinking or even sometimes relate to your current thought train and these thoughts tend to stray to a very dark part of your mind. If we knew our own conscience we would understand why we are thinking this, but we don’t, it’s due to the subconscious. However I would say you take the Freudian approach and say it’s the ID revealing to our conscious mind our actual desire. Aquinas’s use of reason is also something I am very fond of. It is something I think is key to our conscience, without reason we would never understand why we did any action and since most actions, especially big ones require a lot of thought and reason to accomplish I concur that reason is essential to our conscience. Our conscience is essentially for me our driving force that causes us to make decisions and perform actions, and without reason this would be pointless as we wouldn’t need a conscience, we would just make decisions with no thought or logic. The only problem with thinking Ratio is essential, is how do you explain actions that would logically make no sense. This is where I start to disagree with Aquinas and turn to a more Freudian point of view. He states that we need to “cultivate” our Ratio to follow natural law, and that the parts of our subconscious mind we don’t understand are the infestation of demons which stem from the fall. I couldn’t disagree more with this, not only does it sound more like brain washing to serve God rather than cultivation, the idea that our mind is infested with demons stems from the issue that Christianity can’t accept that people aren’t perfect and will make mistakes. For example Joseph Butler believed that our ability to distinguish right from wrong was a God given gift that is just one of many parts of our conscience (the others being basic desires and self love). He did see conscience as the voice of God from within us, or rather a guide given to us by God in order to do the right thing. However he views mistakes as not a big issue, as most of the time most people will know and intuit the right choice. I think this is a much better view to take with this side of the argument, while I don’t agree I can appreciate his understanding that not everyone will always make the right choice. Aquinas tries to make his view by defining two types of ignorance vincible (should have known better) and invincible (genuinely couldn’t be blamed), yet this still doesn’t allow for people who in life may just genuinely make mistakes. John Henry Newman (Cardinal Newman) is also a big activist for God as our inner guide. He stated that “Conscience is the aboriginal Vicar of Christ” and given the choice to take the view of the Pope or his Conscience he said “to conscience first”. What he is saying is that conscience is the original and most holy source of all knowledge given to us by God, which no human of any status could match. For his time his view was modern, as Pope’s were seen as the source of all correct and eternal knowledge. Although I appose the basis for the argument I do understand why people agree with him. He is saying that we have an innate telling of what is right and wrong and that no one can tell us otherwise. God has painted us in his image and no one can give us better moral guidance than him. He has put within us his guide to morals and we should follow that at all costs, if anything that makes you a more diligent Christian as your following the closest thing to God’s word that exist. It is the most direct way to understand God’s morality. I’m still more on the side of Freud. The idea that we have a much deeper mind than we could ever imagine is an idea I agree with. His views have no relation to God, and I think the thing I like about his views the most is that he will happily admit that humans are wholly good. The ID is what we really are, the innate desire to be driven by libido to sex and basic animal desires is what we were put here to do. However society has developed and tried to make humans as a species much more sophisticated, so the ego tries to control the ID and the super ego dominates the subconscious by understanding and try to follow the rules of the society you’re in. The rules you have been taught by parents, teachers, society and anyone else in authority in your life. You are a product of what you hear and are told, combined with a massive dark and animal side. You are at a constant level of conflict. I do disagree with some aspect’s of Freud however, I think that he is too focused on the sexual side of society, while I agree that sex is a big part of our society it isn’t the be all and end all. I’d take the view of Carl Jung that Libido is just a general driving force rather than a force that drives us specifically to sex. Jung also thought we use a “Persona” that we show to the outside world, which I feel is true, we have a face we show to everyone else, that’s why even on sad days most people try and smile. Freud also thought that we are just a product of what we are told and what society has ingrained in us, once again I would take another philosophers view, this time Piaget. At the age of 10 and over we start to form our own views which he called Autonomous morality, a system which I agree with over Freuds. I also feel that guilt is when we choose our subconscious mind over our reason and it back fires, whereas Freud believed it was down to displeasing society’s rules and how the super ego interprets this. So to conclude, I feel that the conscience is a combination of conscience, sub conscience and reason that leads and drives us to make decisions. While I understand the views of Newman and some of Aquinas I also disagree. I take a combination of Freud, Piaget, Jung and some of Aquinas to form a view of the conscience that isn’t related to God. The conscience is our own decision making, not what God has told us to think.

I would personally disagree with this statement. I would regards myself as an emotivist, there is no set moral code or universal set of laws that govern our life. I live my life by the rules that I have created for myself and the rules I have been raised on, but these are still just my emotions towards things in life. For example, following the ideas of Ayers “Hurray/Boo” theory, when someone says “Do you think breaking a promise is wrong” I say “Yes, I think it breaks trust and can ruin relationships”. All I’m doing there is saying “Boo” to the idea of breaking promises, yet to me this still gives the statement meaning, but not in the sense of meaningful to others. Someone else might have no issues with breaking promises, that view is meaningful to them, but irrelevant to me. The ideas of Aquinas, Fletcher, Bradley and Foot set that morals are shared throughout humanity and set in stone, and believe ethical statements have immense meaning to all, which I agree with, to an extent. The idea that ethical statements have meaning to all humans is ridiculous as we all have differing views, but without ethical statements we would have no morals, whether morals are universal or just opinions, without them everyone would begin to commit crimes and society would fall apart. It’s the same reason we have a law, without ethical statements, morals would fade away. As I’ve said before I am an emotivist, and believe that all morals are just opinions and expressions of emotion. But I do believe the that moral statements have meaning, it’s just an individual meaning, rather than a collective meaning. F.H. Bradley had a particular interest in the the atomic structure of humans, and after realising that all humans are made from atoms, he believed that this was our “cosmic link”. The fact we share the same innards means that we should work as “one” and works as a global society. This view I think is a very optimistic view, if it were to work and have no oppression against it, I believe it would be the ideal world. But in reality it would never happen and will never happen in this way. The perfect utopia will never work, and that’s just down to human nature. This reference might seem irreverent but the reason I mention him is because he would believe that ethical statements hold immense weight. As he felt like we were all linked, he would have felt like making statements about morals and ethics would be what held this link together, as if we were all working together we would all share very similar if not the same sort of beliefs. Although I believe that moral statements have individual meaning rather than a meaning collectively, the idea he is putting forward would give meaning to both individual and collective ethical statements. The ideas of Aquinas and Foot would show that ethical statements have meaning. These philosophers are both naturalists, and both had a prescriptive view of morals. Aquinas, who actually created the idea of eternal law, believed that God had created a set of morals and rules that govern the universe, and through the ideas of scripture and learning, or “natural law” as he called it, we begin to understand and act on this “eternal law”. Philippa Foot, who was a fan of Aristotle, devised a four tier system that aimed to prove that morals were set in stone. The idea was that the world has different species and these species have different communities and these communities have different rules which allow them to function properly. Foot argued that the universal moral law was our species rule set, and breaking this rule set has an effect on the overall community. It someone doesn’t fit into these rules, they are seen as a “Bad” member of the species, in the same way if they follow the rules to a tee they are seem as “Good”. For example, you can talk about a tree having “Good roots”, then we can describe a human as having a “Good perception of will”, thus morals exist. I personally don’t agree with either of these ideas. I think Aquinas’s theory of natural law is far too Christianised to be applicable to atheists or even agnostics. Along with the fact that in order for the rule set to work you have to be a believer in God and believe in the Jeduao-Christian God, along with taking the word of the bible as “Fact”, a thing which I have a huge personal disagreement too. Foot’s idea of the four tier system, breaking down the world into a set of rules that have to be followed is much more versatile and as a fan of Aristotle I like the idea, but can’t agree with it. The idea that humans have to follow a set of rules to the tee or are seen as a “bad human” is ridiculous, as it doesn’t allow for circumstances or any context to the action performed. Even the system of law we live in has some sort of human spin on it, ie its put to a group of people for evaluation so there is some emotion in the system. Foot feels too robotic when it comes to these rules, and along with this, moral codes differ from culture to culture. Muslims sacrifice animals for Haaj, and Jews are Circumsized at birth, whereas Christians don’t have either of these traditions. So either the moral code isn’t being followed properly, or there is no moral code at all. These two naturalists would believe in the meaning of ethical statements for millions of years to come, as they would believe that the new generation, or the new members of the community would need to be taught the ideas and morals of the world. Without these statements society would fall apart, and if people weren’t taught about them, in generations they would eventually be forgotten. The intuitionist firmly believes that moral statements are just common sense, they are completely personal. The ideas of Moore, Prichard, and Stevenson are very sensical, no moral can be proven, they are just what you think is right. G.E. Moore believed that there was no way to define goodness, and that goodness was a non-naturalistic property. He said that “everything is what it is and not another things”. Everything is down to a persons common sense and that good things exists just because they are good. The ideas of H.A. Prichard are slightly different. He believed that the quest to find moral obligations was a “pointless”, as there is absolutely no moral law. What we think is “Good” is only good because it will bring about something which we perceive to be good. In other words it is completely subjective and down to ones intuition. He also stated that what we believe to be good, and what we believe to be our “Duty” is sometimes contradictory, but that intuition should chose duty over good. Prichard is claimed with bring ideas of duty and obligation into the moral debate. C.L. Stevenson is simple, he said every view is just intuition, and the only reason you would tell someone your view would be try to persuade them to believe in your own view. These people would have all believed that moral statements are meaningless as everything to do with morals is just intuition. I disagree with Moore and Prichard. When it comes to defining if something is good, we can actually define it, not in the scientific sense, but in an objective sense. In my eyes an actions goodness can be defined in relation the receiver of the act, ie I think buying a girl chocolates on a date is good, because I think that if I were a girl and a man bought me chocolates I would like them. The idea that all moral statements are meaningless isn’t a fair point as when someone is trying to impart knowledge onto you it clearly has meaning to them, so the statement in itself has meaning. The ideas of C.L. Stevenson I do agree with, the only reason you would ever tell someone your opinion would be, whether consciously or not, would be to make sure the other person knows that opinion, and to hopefully get them to agree with your option. To conclude, I am an emotivist, and believe that every moral statement is just an emotional outburst in relation to something in life. But to me that doesn’t mean that it has no meaning. It has deep meaning to me, and therefore that gives the statement meaning. Although I don’t agree with the ideas of Aquinas or Foot, I do agree with them in that ethical statements have meaning. I can understand the ideas of Moore, Prichard, and Stevenson, and appreciate the logic behind their ideas, but at the end of the day it doesn’t matter, as any ethical statement I say will have personal meaning to me, and thus have meaning in itself.

I believe this statement to be true. I believe that God has divine foreknowledge of events, but doesn’t have total omniscience as he has chosen not to know all things, but he can see future events to an infinite degree of accuracy, agreeing with the idea of the restaurant analogy from Schleiermacher. Unlike Process Theology I don’t think God is a changeable being, who isn’t omniscient because he doesn’t have the power to be so. I think more along the lines of Peter Vardy, in that God voluntarily gave himself limitations in order to allow humans to live a genuinely free existence. God lives within our time and space, and can predict the future, see the past and effect the present. I liken my ideology of God within our time to Philip Yancy’s movie extra quote. I also think that even if God didn’t have complete knowledge of every event within time, we would still have free will, as God can overcome all forms of things that are perceived to be a contradiction by us. Being a big Descartes fan I believe in his views of God, him being the source of all logic and being able to change and adapt it at his will. I think the main issue this question has is the confusion it causes. Some define “Divine Foreknowledge” as God being an all seeing and all knowing being who can scroll though our time and space like a man with a TV remote watching a movie. St Anselm believed that there was a 4th dimension in which the time was a factor. The past, present and future coexist. He believed that the terms past, present and future were completely relative to the person perceiving time (ie yesterday was tomorrow two days ago). He stated that “Humans exist in a particular place in space. We are limited. God is unlimited in space and time and therefore can exist in all places in space”. For him god saw everyone and everything at every time all at once, so he had total and complete knowledge of human time. The issue is that if you don’t believe that there is a 4th dimension his argument becomes completely null and void. To me Anselm has essentially tried to describe the idea of a Transcendent God in a way that could be make logical sense in the human constructs of time. I dislike this Idea because he has essentially repackaged a simple idea that has been around for generations (that god is transcendent and knows all) and made it more confusing by converting it into human logic. As said by Aquinas the issue with this theory and many others is that we try to describe parts of an “Unknown God” with human language, when in reality we can’t. Another man who saw divine foreknowledge in this way was Boethius, who’s idea is similar to Anselm’s but more simplistic. He believed God was atop a lofty mountain seeing all, and whatever an omniscient God foresees must happen. God has a much greater view of what’s going on compared to us, and from his mountain can see time all at once. I prefer this idea to Anselm’s as it is much more simplistic and yet still comes out to the same outcome through a logical method. I can understand why this idea would appeal to a christian or any theist for that matter. The idea of the lofty mountain peak feels  very much like a reference to God sat in heaven watching over us. Although I understand the appeal for this idea it doesn’t change the fact that I disagree with it. Not only do I disagree with the idea of an all seeing and knowing god but his argument also has a massive hole. Boethius said that it didn’t matter whether an event happens because God sees it or God sees and event because it happened. To me there is a world of difference between these definitions, its the difference between God being involved in our world and not being, the difference between God manipulating us as humans or just seeing what we caused to unfold. If God sees what has happened without causing it, then we have the illusion of free will, to us things seem free and there is no external force causing them to not be, yet because God has seen them they become set. If a time traveler travels to 2030, it means he has made the event he has turned up at set, but how we get there is our choice. Admittedly it is different for god, as he can see every event, so we have no free will as all events are set, but to us we still do. He hasn’t inherently made things happen, it’s just a consequence of his power. If he makes things happen, not only does that contradict his being outside our time because he can’t logically be inside and outside our time, it also means that we God hasn’t just removed our free will, but has also made us puppets and he is pulling the string, we just do whatever he makes us do. This also leaves every moral evil ever committed at the feet of God, he made us do those evils and also could have foreseen the consequences of them. So that would inherently make God a culmination of every evil person and act ever have existed. The main and unarguable shutdown to this side of the argument comes from Descartes and Matthew 19:23. Descartes believed God has complete omnipotence and can do everything logical and illogical, because nothing is illogical to God as he is the source of all logic. God knowing everything and us having free will doesn’t make sense to us, but God could easily manipulate logic itself to turn this confusing contradiction into a very coherent statement. For as Matthew 19:23 says “with man this is impossible, but for God everything is possible”. This would surely make both Gods complete knowledge and human free will compatible, not according to Richard Swinburne who believes that we define “everything” incorrectly. He states that for something to be considered a “thing” it must not be a contradiction of itself, ie a square circle isn’t a thing as this is a contradiction within it self, neither is a rock too heavy for God to lift. Another issue that is had with this question is the idea of “Free Will”. The concept of human free will is not only hard to grasp but also impossible to define from our perspective. Whether we have the “Illusion” of free will, in which we have absolutely no free choices in reality but to us we feel we had multiple choices or actual free will is a completely impossible distinction to make. If someone locks you in a room with a door on the ceiling you can’t reach and tells you the door is locked you will never know if the door is actually locked or is just closed. It is ridiculous to try and predict something of such nature that you would have to the man who locked the door to know which one it is. In that analogy, we are in the room and the man who locked the door is God. Only God knows whether we have true free will or not. Not only is there this problem, but defining “Free” is just as hard. I would regard myself as a free citizen, but I am still bound by laws that apply to the country of England and by the laws of Physics. Some believe in the idea of Predestination (although it is a much more common belief within Muslim communities it is also mentioned in Christianity). God knows when we are born and the moment that we die, but everything in between that is totally up to us. He may have put us in some bounds but within those bounds we have the an infinity of choices to make. With this the Free Will and God’s Foreknowledge can coexist without having to compromise free will or God’s Knowledge of the time. This ties into to the theories of Alvin Plantinga and Peter Vardy. Alvin Plantinga believed that an omnipotent God not have omnipotence as a necessary quality, a God with omnipotence would choose to limit himself to allow humans to have free will. The view of Peter Vardy isn’t dissimilar, he believed that the only thing that can limit God is what God choses to limit him. He also states that God made the universe built and tailored for rational and free human beings. I personally think it is a little bias and elitist to think that God made the universe so that to allow us to be free and rational since there are millions of different species on this planet alone and who knows what other life lives out in the depths of the universe. For all we know another alien species could believe God built the universe for them. The thing I do agree with is that if God did have unlimited knowledge and power, he would still choose for us to have free will. Whether that through his limiting his own power or because he can overcome contradiction I don’t personally know or have an opinion over. I do however agree with Plantinga in that an omnipotent God wouldn’t have necessary omnipotence as a quality. As with this free will could absolutely never exist and I doubt that God would allow that to happen, although as things like God sending the locusts or killing first borns does show, he can be quite ruthless and merciless at times, according to the Bible. The final way this question can be tackled is by presuming that God never had the power for total knowledge in the first place, and that he never had true omniscience. The most famous of philosophers to agree with this theory is Schleiermacher. He believed that God can predict events without having actual knowledge of them, thus still allowing for human free will to exist. He likened it to taking a life long friend, relative or spouse to a restaurant. If they ask you to order for them, you could with immense accuracy, and most likely, be able to order the food they want to eat. Yet there is still a chance that the guess is wrong. This small percentage is what allows human free will and God’s divine foreknowledge to exists together. This is the way that I most agree with, I can understand the logic of other ways to prove this question, but I have always seen God as not a being with ultimate power. I also think that making God relatable to humans, ie he may have knowledge of what everyone will probably do, but like every human on planet earth, is just in reality taking guess makes the idea much more appealing to a mass of people. That being said I have a problem with this. I would personally have this in conjunction with God’s omnipresence, as he would have to know the intimate workings of everyone one and thing in our existence to accurately predict the next 5 seconds of time. Schleiermacher never mentions this and I think his argument alone makes God seem subpar in comparison to what he is said to be. The issue is if God has nothing extra above us, then what makes him God. A God who guesses with no extra knowledge surely just makes him an average guy. It takes away from his Godliness. 
But this style of God does fit into the idea of the God from Process Theology, which states that God is a changeable, and reacts to things in our universe. He isn’t the traditional God that the Judo-Christian Religious have created. He isn’t omniscience as he is in our time, he makes mistakes, reacts to prayers, things can have an effect on him which removes his omnipotence, but most importantly of all he improves over time. This is still considered to be a form of God, yet he doesn’t have any form of eternal power, presence or even knowledge. If anything he isn’t dissimilar from us, yet he is still considered a God. To me this means that Schleiermacher’s idea of a God who can only guess at what is to come is still God, it is not a step down from God or a lesser God, all versions of God are still God. To conclude,  I agree that free will and God’s divine foreknowledge can coexist. This is mainly because like Schleiermacher and Process Theology I don’t think God has omniscience, yet can still be God even without this ultimate knowledge. While I can understand and appreciate the ideas of Boethius and Anselm, I can’t agree that God has complete knowledge, nor that he is outside of our time. I believe it would be against his nature to be out of our time, to leave his creation (as the bible says) to fend for itself. I also believe that even if God did have this total and all baring knowledge of the universe and time itself, we would still have free will. As said by Plantinga and Vardy, he would limit himself to allow us to have free will or as said by Descartes and Matthew 19:23 he could over come this contradiction as he is simply God.

I personally agree with this statement, as I feel that philosophical language is only really applicable in the context of a philosophical discussion. For example, the term “Language Game” is only applicable when you are talking in the context of Ludwig Wittgenstein. I think this system also applies to Religious Language as D.Z. Philips said, religious language only carries meaning within the context of religion. While I do believe that Wittgenstein’s language game is a very sound and coherent argument, I can understand why counter-arguments such as Antony Flew’s falsification theory, Logical positivist views of the Vienna Circle (where for a statement to be meaningful, it requires empirical evidence) and A.J. Ayers Hurray/Boo theory (all ethical statements are meaningless expression of emotion). Ludwig Wittgenstein lived from the years of 1889 through 1951. He was an Austrian-British philosopher of maths, logic and mostly famously language. His language game’s theory is relatively simple. The idea that words only have meaning when placed in context. A scientist will use the word “Result” in a context regarding the result of an experiment or a study and it will mean this in all scientific discussions. Whereas as a football referee the word “Result” will refer to the outcome of a match and will mean this in all football related discussions. He said each of these are “Games” and each game has different rules and once you understand the rules of the game you can partake in it. I can’t be involved in a discussion about Chemistry because I don’t understand the rules of the Chemistry game. D.Z. Philips then honed in on religious language an applied Wittgenstein to it, by saying that all religious language only has meaning in the context of religion. I personally agree with both Philips and Wittgenstein, the argument posed is so simple and easily understood that it is massively appealing. The reason I can’t speak Chinese is because I don’t understand the rules of Chinese. To me, listening to a man speak Chinese means nothing to be, but to a native speaker listening to the same man they may be moved by what he is saying. Yet I think that Wittgenstein sadly has one issue, use of the word “Game”. Wittgenstein’s argument has so many pros, yet is still has some cons. One of its pros is that it removes the need for several definitions for a single word. It removes the need for Univocal and Equivocal language as each word will have a single meaning in each game, rather than having to ponder a words several meanings. It simplifies the entirety of the worlds languages into a simply understandable system with less confusion. Philosophical language will not have as much meaning if any when used outside the context of philosophy, that is just a fact. Wittgenstein has taken this fact and applied it to the entirety of language, which makes his argument very sound and quite hard to either argue against or even criticise. However much I agree with Wittgenstein, his theory does have some flaws. When it comes to philosophical discussion or any discussion its not a game. Using Hegel’s Dialect Method to lay out a philosophical discussion it would go like this; one person would pose a thesis, someone else would challenge it with an antithesis, then after discussion they reach a conclusion. In this system their is a winner, its similar to a game of rock paper scissors, someone choses an idea from an array of idea, the other player choses a counter-idea to challenge this and whoever’s idea is perceived to be stronger wins. Yet in most philosophical discussions Hegel’s method falls down. Most discussions tend to be just that, discussions. An idea is posed and it is discuss for a while and then everyone leaves with ideally more knowledge than they entered with, but there is no winner or losers. Its not a draw or a stale-mate, because it isn’t a game. Yes language, especially philosophical language has rules and meaning that need to be figured out and learnt to partake in it, but there is no game as there is no aim. The counter-argument for this is when C.L. Stevenson said that every ethical statement was an attempt to try and persuade someone to believe in your opinion and if you do this it could technically be viewed as winning. Yet philosophical language can still have meaning even if it doesn’t persuade anyone, it everyone leaves the discussion having enjoyed the time spent on it, or has learnt something new, or came out of it with a positive outlook then that gives it meaning. Wittgenstein’s way of perceiving language and using it to give meaning to philosophical language is completely coherent and makes an immense amount of logical sense, and while I do see the issue of perceiving language as a game when there are, in my opinion, no winners. I still think that his argument is coherent and strong, but I can see the appeal of some of the counter-arguments. One of these opposing opinions is the Logical Positivist view of the Vienna Circle. The Vienna Circle were around in the period of 1924 to 1936 and were a group of people who coined the term Logical Positivism. They aimed to be the scientist of philosophy, using empirical evidence to prove something is true. They said that for a sentence to have meaning it must be empirically tested, or it is a tautology (the truth comes entirely from the meaning of its terms). According to them only statements that have been shown to be true can have any real meaning, as they impart knowledge. Their view on ethical and philosophical discussion was that they can only have emotive meaning if they influence peoples beliefs or feelings. As a group they are to me very clinical and close minded, as there is no room for fluctuation or exaggerated scenarios in their theory. For them philosophical discussion does have meaning, it just isn’t useful meaning. However, I see a flaw in their argument as if someone who doesn’t know anything about philosophy, and as Wittgenstein said, learns the rules of the philosophical game then surely it has imparted an enormous amount of new knowledge, thus having true meaning. Most of the knowledge imparted in philosophical discussion is A Posteriori, it needs third party evidence to be considered truth. Yet another problem I feel with the Vienna Circle is that they are hypocritical. They discussed philosophy and made ethical statements to get to this conclusion, yet according to them this only had “Emotive Meaning” rather than true meaning. This surely puts emotive meaning on a level playing field to what they regard as true meaning. I also feel that emotive meaning is just as meaningful as empirical meaning, as swaying and expressing emotions can have a much greater impact on people than just stating facts. I personally prefer Wittgenstein to the Vienna Circle, as their theory is far too close minded and not as applicable as the Language Games. I feel that although they have their negatives there are still some positives to the theory. It is very simplistic and easy to understand along with appealing to more scientifically minded people. Their system does work in some cases, for example a government trying to make a long-term decision would only need to take facts as having meaning and ignore all other statements to make an educated decision. Even when it comes to philosophical discussion it is sometimes important to only take on empirical facts rather than peoples bias opinions. While it does have it’s pros, they are sadly outweighed by the amount of cons the theory creates from its close mindedness. Regarding philosophical discussion, it is often vital to take into account peoples opinions along with empirical facts in order to create a coherent argument, and this doesn’t fit into the frame of empirical meaning. This ties into the theory of A.J. Ayer, as he felt that all ethical and philosophical discussion was an expression of emotion, you are either in favour (hurray) or you are in opposition (boo). He also had a theory of weak and strong statement; where the strong statements are empirically tested and sound, and weak statements still need testing to be seen as sound. Although this seems on the surface similar to the view of the Vienna Circle, it differs in one way, emotive meaning still counts to Ayer. He recognised that in language, religious language meaning is different to his weak and strong theory. He was aware of the meaning something emotive or specific without evidence can have in context, “Statements in religious language, like moves in-games, are context dependent”. So while Ayer agrees with the idea of empirical evidence having a higher meaning than a statement with a lack of it, he also adapts a very Wittgenstein view to things that haven’t got evidence or don’t require it. For this reason I feel that Ayer is a much better way to argue against Wittgenstein, he is more modern and willing to adapt, whereas the Vienna Circle is a lot more rigid and unchanging. Ayer recognises that several situations fail to fit the Vienna Circle and adapts a more understanding view of how to deal with these while still sticking to his main theory. I still think that Wittgenstein theory is much more sound, due to the fact that Ayer’s foundation theory falls into the same traps as the Vienna Circle’s theory, but I can understand why this counter-argument it more appealing. Antony Flew poses a much more appealing counter argument but I still feel that Wittgenstein’s argument is more sensical. Flew was an English philosopher who was alive during the period of 1923 to 2010. His argument is simple, instead of trying to verify a statement, you should instead try to falsify it. The definition of falsification is a statement in which we have to provide no supporting evidence for, but we need to be aware of what we rule out by saying it. It is a similar theory to the Via Negativa, in which instead of saying what God is, we say what he isn’t until we reach what he is. The Via Negativa doesn’t work nearly as well because we don’t actually know anything about God, for a fact. It falls into the trap that Flew outlined, “An assertion which does not rule out anything, but rather is compatible with any conceivable state of affairs, does not appear to assert anything either”. The Via Negativa never says anything about God because like Aquinas said, God is unknowable, he isn’t perceivable in a human mind. Flew however took this idea and revised it, then applying it to the whole of language. I believe that Flews argument has some very substantial points. His argument, like Wittgenstein’s is simple and makes logical sense. When we don’t know for sure what to say about something, or we are trying to reach a conclusion with only a few facts, in order to find out more facts, you have to illuminate what you know not to be facts. If in a philosophical discussion I say  “I disagree with this” and then provide a counter-argument I am going to have a much better leg to stand on rather than saying “I agree with this” and delivering a speech as to why I agree with it. To me you bring more meaning to a philosophical discussion by falsifying rather than verifying. In philosophy verifying a fact will never teach you anything new, but challenging one, falsifying one will provide a much more in-depth and interesting discussion. While I do think that Flew has a good and fair argument, I think he falls down with how long it would take to reach a conclusion from his idea. He falls into the same trap the Via Negativa does. It would takes years to reach the same conclusions about God that verification would. To falsify in philosophy would mean that you would have to say everything you think something to not be, only to reach the same conclusion as a verifier did, except you wasted a lot of time. Your argument may be more sound and with more evidence but it reaches the same outcome. Wittgenstein’s argument is much more simple, if you know the rules of philosophical language you can take part in meaningful discussion. Whether the statement is empirically right or not is irrelevant. Flew toys to prove things by saying everything they aren’t, but to Wittgenstein rightness and wrongness doesn’t add any meaning to language. It’s all just a simple game with a set of rule and just as in chess a game will be meaningful whether you lose or not, you have to know how to play for that game to have any meaning. So to conclude. Wittgenstein’s argument is sound and logical, and proved quite hard for me to argue against. While I do see the appeal of the Logical Positivist view as it is very easy to understand and creates a science try to grasp the complexities of language, it is too close minded for me, and because of this becomes much less applicable to all situations. A.J. Ayer is a much modern twist on this old theory, and while his theory is more versatile as he takes the theory of Wittgenstein built on the foundation of Logical Positivism. It however is built on the same theory of the Vienna Circle and thus falls into the same traps as that theory. Flew poses, in my opinions the most agreeable counter-argument, with his idea of falsification. Yet it becomes a much longer way to reach the came conclusion of verification. It is a spin on the Via Negativa, and that becomes a long winded way of ascertaining nothing. While I can see the positives of the counter-arguments against Wittgenstein, I still feel that even though Wittgenstein does have some flaws, his theory provides the most logical and easily understandable way to understand language, while being extremely hard to argue against and the most applicable and versatile argument to language ever posed in my opinion.

*S,* Drama/Theatre
The initial inspiration for our piece of theatre was in fact, the lockdown. Or more specifically, the way the lockdown links to control. As we have all been locked up in our homes, it can sometimes feel that the control we have over our lives has dwindled immensely and due to the mass of confusion people like Boris Johnson are causing, it feels more and more unlikely we will be getting that control back anytime soon. This lack of control was what we wanted to focus on, as we related to the topic on a personal level. During the pandemic we have all experienced a loss of control at some point, and we thought this lack of control was interesting and very topical. We began to look back over several of the pandemic announcements and BBC interviews with real people highlighting their confusion. News articles titled “Are you still confused about the lockdown?”, and “'Mass confusion' over coronavirus contact tracing system. The hypocrisy involved in Dominic Cummings and his breach of lockdown just highlights the genuine mess that the government has slowly become. After some failed ideas involving the style of Brecht, and the ideas of Theatre of Cruelty (as we found it hard to express our ideas through either of these practitioners) we came across The Paperbirds, a non-naturalistic movement-based storytelling (through the use of verbatim) theatre company. We decided that we would give this practitioner a try, then after some research we found that The Paperbirds begin their devising process over Zoom. This fit perfectly into the situation we had been thrown into, as it allowed us not to see this situation as a disadvantage, but rather an advantage. The Paperbirds begin by doing tasks at a distance, ie sending each other items and sparking an idea from them, or reading through a newspaper article and replacing some words with actions. We saw that immediately these guys would fit our idea. Not only do they devise from a distance, a scenario that was unexpectedly thrown at us, but after watching some of their pieces of theatre such as “Mobile” (a play which tackles the struggles of climbing the class ladder, while all being set in a caravan) and “Thirsty” (a play about the misconceptions of drunk women while being set entirely in three toilet cubicles), we found the non-naturalistic style they take when tackling a complicated issue was an aspect we liked and were interested to incorporate into our piece. The Paperbirds tend to also pick topical and interesting issues facing the world at the time, which fit our theme of control perfectly. Our initial idea was to create a play about a boy who during a driving lesson crashes his car, making his dad a paraplegic and giving himself extreme OCD. We thought that the idea of relating mental health to our theme of control felt very topical and would be quite interesting to explore the mind of someone with OCD and the complications that aren’t shown on the surface. Yet we felt something was missing, and quickly realised that we had missed a crucial part of The Paperbirds ethos. The Paperbirds believes in telling peoples stories, so they take whatever theme or thread came out of the few weeks of exercises they’ve done at a distance, and begin asking real people questions related to it. They take these stories and create a piece from them, using these stories as dialogue within the play. We decided to take a risk and scrap this idea. We instead started with verbatim so as a group we created a questionnaire (Would you rather loose control of your arm or your phone? Would you say you are a controlling person? etc) for some vocalised verbatim, and we created an online Google form with the question “Tell us about time you felt like you lost control?”. We had nearly 55 answers from the form and about 13 answers recorded for the questionnaire, finding that the common themes were Work/School, Drugs, Relationships, and Eating disorders. We took these four themes and decided to make a 4 episode piece, using the verbatim to form each of the stories, using the verbatim as dialogue. This idea felt a lot better, as we were following the proper The Paperbirds method, by taking real peoples stories and expressing them to the audience. For me personally, I found this situation to be an issue for my devising process. My individual aim a performer for this devised piece was to create a convincing character that I was proud of given the circumstances, and I knew the only way that I was going to achieve this was to practise acting even during the lockdown. I made several characters in lockdown, from miscellaneous objects in my house, where I gave myself a time limit to grab an object from each room within my home, and based off of these objects create a personality and character from them, and put them in a scenario that would fit. For example, I got some paper, a candelabra, an open sweet bag, and a kitchen knife and fro this created a 21 year old boy, who has just finished university coming home to clear his childhood bedroom. It meant a lot to me that I kept up acting during the pandemic, as when I got back to school to begin devising in person, I didn’t want it to be at a disadvantage. Being locked at home is how The Paperbirds begin their research and devising process, finding stories and creating ideas. I used the technique of creating theatre from within your own home, making use of the space and objects I had at my disposal in order to fulfil my aim of creating convincing characters given the circumstances.

We used The Paperbirds approach in our devising process. The Paperbirds has a relatively simple devising process. Find some stimulus and from it gather an “Umbrella” (a general theme for the piece), for us our stimulus was the current political climate and the mess it has been in recently along with the lockdown. This led us to the idea of exploring lack of control and we eventually narrowed it down to the “Umbrella” of control. The Paperbirds next explore the “Umbrella”, conducting interviews, finding historical facts, gathering statistics and adding their own opinions into the mix. We then decided to take this “Umbrella” and create an idea from it. The idea came out to be the story of a car crash victim who gained OCD from the crash and paralysed his dad. The story was going to be about how he slowly came to terms with his new mental illness, along with his dad doing the same, and how his coming to terms affects others such as his friends. We researched how car crashes can affect mental health, gathered statistics on the likelihood of OCD from a car crash, along with forming our own opinions on the subject. Although this was a good idea, the issue came with gathering verbatim. We had created the piece and thought of adding verbatim afterwards to do with mental health, not correctly following The Paperbirds method of letting the verbatim shape the story or giving a “voice to the voiceless” as they say. So we scrapped the idea and try again, still with the “Umbrella” of control. We began by creating and sharing an anonymous form with the question “Tell us about a time you think you lost control and how did this affect you”. This got over 50 responses of real peoples stories surrounding control. We also conducted a series of audio interviews with people, each with several questions relating to control such as; “Would you give someone control of your phone or arm”, “Would you say you’re a controlling person”, etc. These two things, our personal views and feelings, along with researching into stereotypes of control and being controlling lead us to create our “Strands” (a set of topics you want to cover in the piece that fall under the “Umbrella”). The Paperbirds use these “Strands” as the basis for the piece. Our’s came out to be; school stress, eating disorders, relationships and drugs. The Paperbirds then collect all of this and create a “tapestry of scenes”, which is essentially the creation of the piece. This is the part which took by far the most time. A moment I recall changing vastly from the original idea is the school stress scene. We started by narrowing down what topics were covered in the verbatim and found that being overloaded with work was the main problem, so we decided to make our scene surround this. We began with the idea of stacking and unstacking some chairs, with both Aidan and Kalai unstacking them whilst I was talking. The pace would slowly increase to create an air of stress and anxiety. I used The Paperbirds “Heightened Verbatim” method to create my character from a story about work overload in our verbatim. The “Heightened Verbatim” method means you read the verbatim, and make assumptions on what sort of person wrote it, combined with artistic license to create a borderline stereotypical character that would have said this verbatim. The idea of stacking chairs was quickly switched, as it felt slightly random and didn’t fit with the theme of school stress. It changes me restocking a selection of books, and we struck the size of the area I could go in, adding to the overall stress of the scene and sticking to the school stress theme. Yet there was still an issue, as this particular interview was anonymous I found it hard to portray what I thought the character might be like. I initially used a closed body language, head down, no eye contact, slow breathe and arms tightly in front of me to play the stereotypical weedy character, buckling under the stress. Yet this somehow didn’t feel right, so I once again adapted. This time to a more confident character, shown through the protection of my voice, confident tone, slow speech, deeper voice combined with shoulders back and head up. This felt more accurate but still didn’t fit the story, so I decided this story would work. We wanted to portray a student under immense stress, and we wanted the audience to feel that stress along with him, the scene needed reworking. The first change we made was we added an alarm clock into the scene, which whenever it went off I had to drop what I was doing and hit it, then the scene would tableaux and Aidan would say directly to the audience the verbatim using The Paperbirds technique of “Naturalistic Verbatim” (using body language to create a very naturalistic and toned-down version of the person saying the verbatim, while delivering exactly what the person has written down). As for my character, I decided to tell my own story of exam stress, creating a monologue of my own experience. This worked much better, the alarm clock highlighted the stress of the piece even more by contrasting it with moments of stillness, and the monologue fit the scene much better. My character was also convincing, as I used the “Naturalistic Verbatim” method instead of the “Heightened Verbatim” method to play a naturalistic version of myself at that stage in my life. Strangely I ended up combining the two stereotypical characters I had previously created and toned them down and fitted them into my character, beginning reasonably calm and confident and slowly buckling and fading under the immense weight he feels is on his shoulders. The final addition was having me writing at a desk, and Kalai coming over and destroying my work so I had to start again. This was to show that when under an immense workload it feels like you’re never getting anything done. On the night this scene went down great, the audience felt the stress along with me, which is good because The Paperbirds want to make an impression on the audience, which this scene certainly did. This wasn’t the only moment that underwent change however, the relationships scene went under a huge array of changes. This scene had to be perfect as we decided it would be our “Frame” (a word The Paperbirds use for a scene that interweaves into other scenes, as my scene is to do with my relationship with work, Aidan’s is about the relationship with drugs, and Tom’s is about the relationship with food we thought that this was the perfect “Frame”). Kalai had, using the verbatim and the “Heightened Verbatim” method (along with toning the character down to a level of naturalism) created a monologue about your perception of other peoples perception of you. As The Paperbirds uses a lot of non-naturalistic movement in its pieces we decided we wanted the other three character in this scene to show everything through movement. Our initial idea was to come out of our respective characters and act out whatever actions Kalai was saying during his monologue, combining jagged and jerky movements with slow and flowing action, along with distorted facial expression and moments of unison. We also varied timing between actions to make the whole movement sequence seem strange and abstract. However, we thought this idea took away from the simplicity of the monologue. The monologue is a stream of consciousness, and acting out the actions portrayed in it not only overcomplicated the monologues simplistic and flowing nature but it also took the focus away from what he was saying and put more focus on the movements we were doing. This idea changed into a “resetting” of the piece, since in every scene objects had moved we thought it would be nice to one by one slowly reset each of our rooms while the monologue played out. However, we did take this idea and decided it would fit much better with the strange and almost psychedelic nature of the drugs scene. This was to show that the piece is circular, showing that you can never escape the grasping claws of control, it continues through everything you do, each and every day. While once again another good idea we still felt that as this was our frame, this needed to have its own focus. So we decided to do what we had been doing in all other scenes, when not in a certain room we would do subtle activities (for me it was checking the time, write something down and wipe my face) in our respective rooms so we were never off stage and never stopped acting. This allowed the scene to have to focus it needs, and we decided to make this scene last as it was the most poignant and the more astute of audience members would put the dots together and realise the other scenes are bled into by this scene. The final plot went as so. We decided to lay it out as a house, as all the scenes seemed to fit into a room within a house (school stress being the bedroom, eating disorders being the kitchen, relationships being the Attic, and drugs being set in front of the house) and we went from one scene to another, with each room in the house being the only thing lit, with non-naturalistic movement in the transitions. The first scene was school stress, the next was eating disorders, the penultimate was drugs, and we finished with our “Frame” of relationships. Our final dramatic intention was to show the ways in which control affects our everyday lives, and I believe that we achieved this. One of the things I think that best showed this are the transitions between scenes, the non-naturalistic and unusual movement showed to the audience consistent flow from one scene to another, while still being in the style of The Paperbirds. This highlighted that control flows from activity to activity everyday, consistently weaving its way into things. The always acting and always being on stage helped to show this as well. Both of these combined make a sense of the piece being a whole, not broken into scenes or acts, but as one series of flowing events. This helped to convey our message of control being in our everyday lives as in a day, every event flows into the next. The verbatim in the drugs scene was also very poignant, as one of the stories was about someone dying at the hands of alcohol followed by some words of advise relating to drugs. While using verbatim is the of The Paperbirds, it also helped to convey our message. Using punchy stories from real people who’ve had real experiences solidifies our message in the mind of the audience, it’s not just us trying to show the audience what we believe control in our everyday lives looks like, but it is showing to the audience what other people have felt control means to them. This, the transitions and consistently being in character gave our dramatic intention a sense of realism and individuality just not achievable without using The Paperbirds method of theatre.

For our extract one we did a play called “Doctor Faustus” by Christopher Marlowe. Doctor Faustus is a tragedy. We focused on the scene in which Faustus is introduced the seven deadly sins in hell, in which I was to play Doctor Faustus himself. We chose to do the scene in the style of immersive theatre, in order to give the audience a unique and personal view on our scene. Our practitioner was a group called “PunchDrunk” who are an immersive theatre company, who focus on physicality and setting to portray to the audience the mood and feel of a play or character (i.e they would smother a room in red cloth and other red things in order to make it obvious to the audience that the character who own this room is feeling enraged). In order to get a feel for the PunchDrunk style, we created a immersive set inside of a large room, using lighting and colour to create different moods in different sections of the room, our aim was to create a section for each of the seven deadly sins inside of this room. We used this to learn about each one of the sins, and how they can be represented in the style of PunchDruck, and it really helped as it provided the opportunity to really understand the characters I would be interacting with, as getting to know the sins and how they can be represented meant I could understand them in a way I just couldn’t have done before. Then I began to workshop my character, I only had 3 lines of dialogue, so I had to make sure that my physicality represented how my character was feeling. This also fitted into the style of PunchDrunk as they very rarely use dialogue, and uses physicality and movement to thoughts and emotions of the character in any given moment. This is where my first challenge was presented to me, how was I going to portray Faustus. I decided to as a fearful but determined man, who is scared of his fate to come but has the determination and guts to argue and negotiate his way out of it, even if that means visiting hell to talk to Lucifer himself. Then came the physicality of the character, I decided he would have a fast gait, broad shoulders, loose arms which would sway as he walked, chin up and his eyes would be fixed straight ahead, as if he is looking to something. This all leads to a very open body language, showing he isn’t scared or fearful of what’s to come. His facial expression has frowned eyebrows, the rest of the face will be quite neutral, no smile or much expression. This is all of the physicality for his determined side, it all changes when he starts to become scared. His gait slows down, and his shoulders become closer together, he starts to look more towards the ground, and his chin points slightly down, which creates a closed body language for the character, showing his fear. His facial expression remains mostly the same, his is still neutral, but his eyebrows are slightly up rather than down as they were before. All this culminates in a loss of confidence for the character, and portraying to the audience that he is genuinely scared. My intention for my character was to portray his emotions through his physicality and movement, and according to my drama teacher, “I can really see the contrast between his confident side and his scared side”, so I feel like I have succeeded. After I had finished with my character, we rehearsed the scene, and planned out how our characters would interact. In this scene I was portrayed more as powerless. I walk in with confidence, and loose it throughout the scene. The sins (Aidan and Jasper) took control of me, pushing and pulling me all over the set. The relationship between me and the sins was very one sided, I didn’t want to be there, they know this but take control of me against my wishes. In order to make this as natural as possible, we had to rehearse it a lot. But one of our biggest challenges was to make sure that I didn’t get hurt, as some of the lifts and pushes could have been dangerous, we fixed this by having be overseen by our teacher and doing several rehearsals to make sure we were all in sync, I also had to be massively aware of my set, to insure that I didn’t fall onto any blocks or objects, to avoid injury. For example we used a wood chair that we had as part of our scene, I get sat down in it by the sins, but I had to make sure that I didn’t tip or miss the chair as that cold have causes not only injury to me, but possible to the other performers. We also had our drama teacher supervise to make sure that everything was done safely. As a group we also pulled in ideas from the practitioner Frantic Assembly and incorporated some of there physical theatre ideas (i.e some of there lifts and pulls).  Although my character didn’t interact with the audience, I had to consider them in order to make sure that we were safe. For example when I was pushed to the group by Aidan I had to make sure that if there was an audience behind me, that I don’t fall into them. So I had to make sure that whenever I fell or was pushed back, that I didn’t hit any audience members. This proved a challenge was when work shopping the piece there was no audience, but I managed to make sure that my falls were controlled and if needed could be moved. In order to add extra safety, we had to limit the amount of people who could come into our set at any one time, to avoid clogging and reduce accidents.
 
For the second of the three extracts we did an absurdist play called “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead” by Tom Stoppard. It’s an absurdist piece of theatre with comedic scenes and elements. Absurdist theatre is the theatre of nothing and is a form of hyper-naturalism, where silences are long and uncomfortable and the characters don’t achieve anything. The play commonly has a goal which is never reached, for example this play is about two messengers waiting for Hamlet to return, which he never does. We focused on the first scenes in the play, a scene where Rose and Guild sit on the floor discussing probability while flipping coins in an impossible streak of over 90 heads in a row. Our practitioner of choice was Jerzy Grotowski, a practitioner who doesn’t just do absurdist theatre. He key view for absurdism is that silence is key and less is more. He didn’t believe dialogue was always necessary, if there is nothing to be said, then don’t say it. To get a better feel for the Grotowski method, we ran through the piece for the first time, making every scripted silence far too long, just to get an idea of how long each silence should be, without boring the audience. This is where we also realised we had to come up with some creative coin flipping methods, as we had to flip 32 coins, and that gets very boring very fast. So we started writing down and rehearsing different and obscure methods of flipping coins, seeing how creative and interesting we could make these. With a basic understanding of the play and practitioner, and a very rough blocking of our piece completed. I had to work on my character. The first aspect I had to keep in mind is that absurdist characters don’t really have any personality. They are very bland, their costumes are neutral, and they have no backstory. The only fact I had from the play was that my character is a scholar, and is evidently more academically intelligent that Guildenstern (as I was playing Rosencrantz) but lacks all common sense. I went over the idea of playing him as an over-intelligent snobby character that always thinks he’s the smartest in a room, always looking down over my nose at people and having the classic posh snobby tone in my voice. After rehearsing this, it was evident that this wasn’t working very well, as it made the intelligence gap too big and gave my character too much personality. It felt too over the top and big. So I toned it down. I initially only toned it down slightly, by bringing the voice back to my regular voice, but still saying everything with passion, and still keeping my shoulders back and chin up. It was still too dramatic for the piece. So once again I toned it down, by a lot this time. Making the character similar to me in physicality and mannerisms (chin neutral and shoulders back but not too far, along with a slow walk/stroll when I was talking about a big subject), but still saying things with a passion. This seemed to fit the piece very well. I tried to make physicality changes subtle, using my eyebrows and facial expression quite a lot, as I was predominately sat down in the piece. After a couple more rehearsals, I had my character nailed down. After our characters were built, we had build the piece. We took our basic blocked out piece and started to build on top of it. We started to do some full run-throughs of the scene, with no idea how we were going to fill the silences (the gaps between coin flips), so we improvised, in order to capture what we do when we are genuinely bored. It proved to have some fun and useful results, for example I found that whistling was a thing I do when I’m bored and thus added it as a mannerism of my character in the final piece. These improvised run-throughs gave us some really good ideas for how we were going to fill the silences. Next we moved onto the coin flips themselves, we had some ideas of interesting coin flips we wanted to do, but after a talk with some friends we realised that some of them weren’t even flips at all, so we needed to adapt those. Then we pieced them into the scene putting them into the silences periodically, this is when we had the idea of starting the scene early, ie we would do a series of coin flips before even a single word of dialogue was said. This proved to be a good idea as it gave the audience a good clue of what we were doing to pass our time, and helped to show how much time we have spent flipping these coins. One vital thing we had to work on was character relationship. We wanted the characters to feel like they had a strong relationship but a very annoying one aswell, similar to the relationship shared between Laurel and Hardy or Del and Rodney from Only Fools and Horses. In one scene I pull Guildenstern onto my lap and rest my head on his shoulders, but to us that isn’t peculiar in the slightest, as we are so used to each others company. I think that was a much needed addition to the piece to show how strong the relationship between these two characters are. Yet at other moments, Guild will interrupt me and disturb my train of thought, or do something stupid and drive me crazy (shown through my deep an hard exhaling and a slow closing of the eyes). Absurdist theatre does at times incorporate the audience, so we had to keep that in mind when performing, I did this through glances or disappointment at the audience when Guild was annoying me and looking out into the audience when I my character had nothing else to do. The final thing we had to watch out for was heath and safety. I had to ensure I didn’t flip coins into the audience, or hit Guild with any coins. The way I did this is I did rehearsals of just flipping coins, no dialogue or anything, just practising flipping coin in a controlled manner, and in a small space, forcing me to control my coin flips so I didn’t any walls. This gave me the skills to be able to flip coins in a very controlled and safe manner, ready for the final piece.
